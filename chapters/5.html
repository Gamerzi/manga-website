            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The ruins of Elarin were burning.</p>
                <p>Kael stood at the center of a newly formed crater, steam rising from the cracked earth beneath him. His body pulsed with raw energy—symbols and runes danced over his skin like living tattoos, etched by the Bloodline Protocol itself. The gauntlet fused with his arm now shimmered a deep obsidian red, as if feeding directly from his rage.</p>
                <p>The Echo Blade—his sister’s twisted duplicate—hovered midair, her armor cracked, her eyes dimmer.</p>
                <p>“You unlocked Version Zero,” she said, breathless. “That form was erased from the archives… even the gods feared it.”</p>
                <p>“I’m not a version,” Kael growled. “I’m the original.”</p>
                <p>Lira stood at his side, still reeling. She had seen Kael fight before. But this was different.</p>
                <p>He wasn't fighting with desperation anymore. He was fighting like a man who had nothing left to lose.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Meanwhile</em><br><em>Citadel of Ash – Throne of the Forgotten</em></p>
                <p>Smoke curled lazily over mountains of bone and rust. The being known as Ashivar—the firstborn of the Mirrorborn—sat atop a throne that fed off decayed timelines.</p>
                <p>He held a dozen hearts in his hand, each pulsing with red light.</p>
                <p>“History bends,” Ashivar whispered, stroking one of the hearts. “The Veyrin boy walks toward his crown. Let’s see if he still bleeds like a mortal.”</p>
                <p>Behind him, a legion of death-machines powered by necro-etheric cores hissed into motion.</p>
                <p>The Extinction War had begun.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Elarin Ruins</em></p>
                <p>The Echo Blade hovered back. Cracks spiderwebbed through her chestplate, revealing circuitry and veins of silver ichor.</p>
                <p>Kael stepped forward, power still flaring in every direction. “You said I started the war. So tell me—how?”</p>
                <p>The Echo hesitated.</p>
                <p>“You survive,” she said. “You reclaim the Veyrin Mantle. You break the seal on the Arc-Kernel. And when the world tries to stop you…”</p>
                <p>Her voice softened. “You kill everyone. Even me.”</p>
                <p>Kael’s fists clenched. “No. I’ll change it. I’ll rewrite that fate.”</p>
                <p>Lira raised her blade. “But first, we need to survive the now. Something’s coming.”</p>
                <p>A pulse echoed through the ruins.</p>
                <p>From the sky, black shards rained like obsidian hail. And from those shards rose creatures made of code and shadow—soldiers of Ashivar.</p>
                <p>They weren’t attacking. They were summoning something.</p>
                <p>Lira’s eyes widened. “Those are summoning pillars. They’re trying to bring down a Rift Reaper.”</p>
                <p>Kael’s breath caught.</p>
                <p>A Rift Reaper—creatures that devoured cities in minutes, living anomalies that consumed magic, memory, even time. Only one had ever been killed. It took a god to do it.</p>
                <p>And that god died in the process.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>A Choice</em></p>
                <p>The Echo Blade turned her head slightly.</p>
                <p>“I can hold them back. For a while. You must get to the Obsidian Vault. There’s a weapon there. One that can rewrite causality without killing the user.”</p>
                <p>Kael hesitated.</p>
                <p>“You were created to kill me,” he said. “Why help me now?”</p>
                <p>“I saw what you became. And I saw why you became it.”</p>
                <p>She stepped forward, pressing a memory core into his hand. “Watch this when the time is right. Until then… survive.”</p>
                <p>Then, without another word, the Echo Blade surged forward into the growing swarm of Riftspawn.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Kael turned to Lira. “We go to the Vault. We get the weapon. We rewrite this story.”</p>
                <p>Lira smiled grimly. “Just like that?”</p>
                <p>He nodded. “Just like that.”</p>
                <p>They ran. As behind them, the sound of war echoed through what remained of Elarin.</p>
