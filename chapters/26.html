                <p>The first blast shook the walls of Tareth Kai like the roar of a fallen star. Arcane fire laced with cursed runes crashed into the outer defenses, and the sky cracked open in a wash of red and violet lightning. The earth itself groaned beneath the feet of the defenders as the Harbinger’s arrival fractured the laws of nature.</p>
                <p>Kael stood on the western tower, his cloak whipping in the wind. His eyes burned—not with magic, but with certainty.</p>
                <p>This was the end.</p>
                <p>Or the beginning.</p>
                <p>It all depended on what he was willing to give up.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Army of Shadows</em></p>
                <p>Nyros’s army stretched from horizon to horizon, made of constructs, resurrected soldiers, corrupted mages, and beasts born of nightmare and science. Their armor was etched with dark glyphs, and many no longer bled red. They moved without rest, fear, or thought—puppets of a singular, unholy will.</p>
                <p>At the center of it all, a floating war-engine shaped like a collapsing star hovered just behind Nyros. Its core, the Void Prism, pulsed with the essence of the Harbinger.</p>
                <p>Lira stood beside Kael, tightening the straps of her spell-forged gauntlets. “When that thing opens fire, we’ll be torn apart like leaves.”</p>
                <p>“That’s why we can’t let it,” Kael said. “We go before it does.”</p>
                <p>Jorin landed beside them, emerging from a dimensional slipstream with fresh blood on his blade. “East wall’s compromised. Revenants are holding, but they won’t last forever.”</p>
                <p>“We don’t need forever,” Kael said. “We need until I reach Nyros.”</p>
                <p>Jorin blinked. “That’s suicide.”</p>
                <p>Kael stared at the black storm gathering beyond the battlefield.</p>
                <p>“No,” he said. “That’s justice.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Stormfront Clash</em></p>
                <p>When the gates opened, Kael led the charge.</p>
                <p>He rode on a reconstructed shadow-steed—half beast, half mana-manifestation—surrounded by the elite vanguard: spellcasters, mech-knights, and awakened Revenants who’d chosen rebellion over submission.</p>
                <p>The moment they crossed the barrier, chaos swallowed them.</p>
                <p>Sonic disruptors exploded in arcs of white noise, rupturing bone and spell-shields alike. Demon-forged sentries leapt from the trenches, claws like living blades. But Kael and his group were already moving—fast, precise, and deadly.</p>
                <p>Lira unleashed bursts of radiant energy, burning through enemy formations. Jorin blinked in and out of reality, cutting down commanders before they even saw him.</p>
                <p>Kael moved like a storm incarnate. His sword, Nullfang, sliced through time-frozen armor. Every strike tore through flesh and metal alike, guided by the Riftheart’s pulse and the fury in his soul.</p>
                <p>Still, the enemy was endless.</p>
                <p>The Harbinger’s influence warped the battlefield. Time fractured in places—minutes looping or skipping. Ground became air. Sound became light.</p>
                <p>And in the middle of it all, Kael pressed forward.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Final Wall</em></p>
                <p>By the time they reached the foot of the throne-spire where Nyros waited, only Kael, Lira, and Jorin remained.</p>
                <p>Bodies littered the field.</p>
                <p>Fires raged in every direction.</p>
                <p>The sky looked more like a shattered void than anything natural.</p>
                <p>And Nyros stood tall, wearing his new form—a fusion of machine, flesh, and divine spark. His eyes glowed with unnatural fire. The crown on his head bled mist. And behind him, the Harbinger watched through countless eyes that did not blink.</p>
                <p>“Kael,” Nyros said, smiling. “You’ve come a long way for a failure.”</p>
                <p>“I didn’t come to win,” Kael said. “I came to end you.”</p>
                <p>Nyros laughed. “So be it.”</p>
                <p>He raised his hand, and the ground erupted. Dozens of ethereal chains burst forth, ensnaring Kael and the others. Jorin vanished in a puff of smoke, reappearing mid-air, but a flash of black lightning struck him down. He hit the ground hard and didn’t move.</p>
                <p>Lira screamed, unleashing a nova of light—but Nyros caught it in his palm and crushed it like sand.</p>
                <p>Kael strained against the chains.</p>
                <p>Nyros approached, slow and smug. “You could’ve ruled beside me, Kael. I offered you divinity.”</p>
                <p>“You offered me a throne built on corpses.”</p>
                <p>Nyros’s eyes narrowed. “Then die with them.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Sundered Flame Awakens</em></p>
                <p>Time stopped.</p>
                <p>Or rather—it stepped aside.</p>
                <p>Kael heard nothing.</p>
                <p>Felt nothing.</p>
                <p>Except her.</p>
                <p>Lira.</p>
                <p>He turned his head. She was still fighting, even as blood poured from her side. Her eyes met his. No fear. Only trust.</p>
                <p>That was when Kael made the choice.</p>
                <p>He called upon the Sundered Flame.</p>
                <p>Reality tore open inside his soul.</p>
                <p>A voice spoke:</p>
                <p>“What will you sacrifice?”</p>
                <p>And Kael whispered:</p>
                <p>“Her.”</p>
                <p>The world collapsed.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Reset</em></p>
                <p>The battlefield vanished.</p>
                <p>Kael stood in a void of white and shadow. The throne. The Harbinger. The war.</p>
                <p>Gone.</p>
                <p>In his hands was a flame.</p>
                <p>Not hot.</p>
                <p>Not cold.</p>
                <p>Just true.</p>
                <p>He stepped forward.</p>
                <p>One more time.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Back in the Storm</em></p>
                <p>Kael reappeared—reborn—just as Nyros raised the Void Prism for a final blast.</p>
                <p>But Kael was faster.</p>
                <p>He plunged the Sundered Flame into the core.</p>
                <p>Light exploded.</p>
                <p>Not destruction—unmaking.</p>
                <p>The entire throne-spire began to unravel. Nyros screamed, his form disintegrating into smoke and sparks. The Harbinger reeled back, letting out a silent wail that cracked the heavens.</p>
                <p>Kael collapsed.</p>
                <p>Lira caught him.</p>
                <p>She was alive.</p>
                <p>He blinked. “But… I…”</p>
                <p>“You gave up what could have been,” she said softly. “Not what already was.”</p>
                <p>The Sundered Flame burned out.</p>
                <p>The Harbinger vanished.</p>
                <p>And with Nyros gone, the Riftgates collapsed—one by one—until the skies were quiet again.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Epilogue: Ashes and Echoes</em></p>
                <p>Weeks later, the world began to heal.</p>
                <p>Tareth Kai was being rebuilt. The Orders had reformed. The Revenants were given new purpose—no longer weapons, but guardians.</p>
                <p>Kael sat on a hillside, overlooking the valley where the Riftgate had once been. Lira sat beside him, her head on his shoulder.</p>
                <p>“Do you ever wonder,” she said, “what would’ve happened if you’d chosen differently?”</p>
                <p>Kael stared into the distance.</p>
                <p>“No,” he said. “Because this… this was the only future worth saving.”</p>
