            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The rain fell in sheets over the ruined city of Tareth Kai, where thunder cracked like cannonfire across the darkened skies. Kael stood at the edge of a shattered tower, cloak torn, gaze fixed on the horizon where Velthren—the ancient sleeper—moved like a shadow across the land.</p>
                <p>Lira joined him, her arm wrapped in a hastily conjured healing band. “He's not destroying. He’s searching.”</p>
                <p>“For what?” Kael asked. “What could a god lose?”</p>
                <p>Lira tilted her head, watching the way Velthren paused near a collapsed cathedral, his swirling eyes scanning the broken domes with what looked like sorrow. “Maybe… himself.”</p>
                <p>Kael had no answer. The Dreamforge still hummed beneath their feet in the catacombs below, its knowledge half-unlocked. But every time Kael touched it, it took more out of him. The visions grew stronger. And stranger.</p>
                <p>One, in particular, haunted him:</p>
                <p>A battlefield where all the stars had gone out. And standing among corpses of both man and god… was him.</p>
                <p>Alone.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Revenants Arrive</em></p>
                <p>The alarms sounded first—ancient chimes echoing from city towers still functional by raw magic alone. Lira spun, drawing her arc-scythe. Kael summoned a shardblade of Rift energy, already pulsing with awareness.</p>
                <p>Then they came.</p>
                <p>Wearing armor laced with celestial metal, faces hidden behind angular visors. Revenants—resurrected war-saints, their minds wiped and reprogrammed to serve Nyros.</p>
                <p>They moved with inhuman precision, blades drawn, no words exchanged.</p>
                <p>Kael stepped forward. “I don’t want to fight you.”</p>
                <p>The leader removed his helmet.</p>
                <p>Kael froze.</p>
                <p>It was Jorin.</p>
                <p>His foster brother. Thought dead during the Siege of Verdain years ago. But now here he stood, eyes like burnt coals, skin laced with glowing circuit marks. A half-life.</p>
                <p>“Kael,” Jorin said flatly. “You shouldn't have come back.”</p>
                <p>“Jorin, it’s me.”</p>
                <p>“I remember. That's why I volunteered to be the one to kill you.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Memory and Metal</em></p>
                <p>The fight was brutal.</p>
                <p>Lira took on three Revenants at once, spinning like a hurricane of red light and glyphfire. Sparks flew as enchanted steel met scythe-forged magic. Kael, meanwhile, clashed with Jorin in the rain-drenched streets, old memories flashing between strikes.</p>
                <p>They used to spar in the mud as children. Now they tore apart stone and steel with every blow.</p>
                <p>“You don’t have to do this!” Kael shouted.</p>
                <p>“I already did!” Jorin roared. “Nyros gave me purpose—resurrected me when you abandoned me in Verdain!”</p>
                <p>Kael’s blade cracked Jorin’s visor. Behind it, Jorin’s face was torn between rage and pain. A man caught between life and programming.</p>
                <p>Kael dropped his weapon.</p>
                <p>“I didn’t abandon you. I searched for you. For years.”</p>
                <p>Jorin hesitated.</p>
                <p>That was enough.</p>
                <p>Kael’s magic surged—not in an attack, but a pulse of memory. The Riftheart let Kael project what he had lived through—digging through ruins, interrogating Nyros’s lieutenants, wandering in madness.</p>
                <p>Jorin fell to his knees, breath shuddering.</p>
                <p>The Revenants froze.</p>
                <p>Then, one by one, they dropped their weapons.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Shattered Chain</em></p>
                <p>Jorin wasn’t fully freed—but the seed was planted. The others, still chained to the core command, hesitated at his rebellion. Lira stepped beside Kael, panting, her scythe dripping with nullblood.</p>
                <p>“If we can free him, we can free them all.”</p>
                <p>“No,” Kael said. “We have to. They aren’t soldiers. They’re victims.”</p>
                <p>They returned underground with Jorin in tow, plugging him into the Dreamforge. Through it, they found the truth of the Revenants’ creation:</p>
                <p>Nyros had used soulbinding runes powered by corrupted Riftstones—tearing pieces of Velthren’s essence and using them to animate the dead. The process was irreversible.</p>
                <p>Unless…</p>
                <p>Kael placed his hand on the Forge again.</p>
                <p>The risk was enormous. It would require channeling Velthren’s own mercy. Letting the fragment inside him bloom.</p>
                <p>It could kill him.</p>
                <p>But he did it anyway.</p>
                <p>Light burst from the Forge, spreading through the city. The Revenants screamed—not in pain, but in release. Their minds untethered. Their souls, realigned.</p>
                <p>And Jorin stood, for the first time in years, as himself.</p>
                <p>“Thank you,” he whispered.</p>
                <p>Kael collapsed.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Vision Beyond Time</em></p>
                <p>Kael awoke not in the Forge—but somewhere else.</p>
                <p>An endless ocean under a shattered sky.</p>
                <p>Velthren stood over him—not massive this time, but man-shaped, cloaked in robes of flickering stars.</p>
                <p>“You dare use my soul?”</p>
                <p>Kael stood unflinching. “You gave it to me.”</p>
                <p>“I gave nothing. It was taken. Broken.”</p>
                <p>Kael pointed at him. “Then help me fix it.”</p>
                <p>Velthren’s eyes dimmed slightly. “Why?”</p>
                <p>“Because Nyros wants to unleash you without your mind. Just your power. He’s building an empire of death. I don’t want to rule. I want to heal.”</p>
                <p>The god paused.</p>
                <p>Then he extended a hand.</p>
                <p>“I will lend you a fraction. But if you falter… I will finish what the others started.”</p>
                <p>Kael took it.</p>
                <p>The ocean split into fire.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Oath of the Freed</em></p>
                <p>Kael awoke in the Dreamforge chamber, eyes glowing silver-white. Jorin and Lira helped him up.</p>
                <p>“What happened?” Lira asked.</p>
                <p>“He agreed,” Kael said.</p>
                <p>“To what?”</p>
                <p>“Helping us stop Nyros… before he turns this world into another chained tomb.”</p>
                <p>They stood among the freed Revenants, who now bowed to Kael—not as a king, but as a guide. One who carried a piece of a god but chose humanity over power.</p>
                <p>Jorin nodded. “We’ll follow you. Not because we owe you—but because it’s right.”</p>
                <p>Kael smiled faintly.</p>
                <p>Then he turned to the horizon.</p>
                <p>Where Nyros was already opening the final Riftgate—calling something even older than Velthren.</p>
