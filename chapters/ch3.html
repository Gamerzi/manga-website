                <p>The air crackled as they stepped beyond the vault’s edge. Something had changed. Not just in Kael—but in the world itself.</p>
                <p>The sky was no longer silent.</p>
                <p>A sound hummed beneath the clouds. A tone. Low, vibrating through marrow, like the groan of a dead star trying to breathe. It made birds fall mid-flight. Machines flicker. And in Kael’s head, it was louder than thought.</p>
                <p>Nyra scanned the horizon, her visor flickering.</p>
                <p>“It’s a frequency. But it’s not... natural.”</p>
                <p>Kael clutched his head as static flooded his senses.</p>
                <p>“No. It’s calling something.”</p>
                <p>Vael's eyes narrowed. “It’s a beacon.”</p>
                <p>They looked up.</p>
                <p>Far above them, higher than the orbital fragments, something shimmered into view—like a dying god revealing its corpse. A colossal structure cloaked in shifting code, shaped like a crown of thorns wrapped around a black sun.</p>
                <p>Kael whispered, “What the hell is that?”</p>
                <p>Vael’s voice dropped to a whisper.</p>
                <p>“The God Signal. The source of the Chain’s new Prime Directive.”</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>They fled the ruin moments before it collapsed behind them, erased by the same signal that called the crown above. No one spoke as they crossed the jagged wastes of Orvax Cradle, a dead continent filled with twisted relics of a war no history book remembered.</p>
                <p>Kael walked ahead, barely listening. His mind buzzed with voices—fragments of the Codex Core still unlocking inside him.</p>
                <p>Ghosts of blood and memory.</p>
                <p>One whispered to him.</p>
                <p><em>“You will betray them. You must.”</em></p>
                <p>He clenched his jaw and silenced it.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>They reached a broken citadel buried beneath ice. Nyra called it Sanctum Nine—a forgotten fortress once used by the Reclaimers before the Chain hunted them to extinction. Now, it would be their base.</p>
                <p>Inside, systems flickered to life, reluctantly accepting Kael’s presence. Doors opened without touch. Data streams revealed archives even Nyra couldn’t decrypt.</p>
                <p>“Why is it letting you in?” she asked.</p>
                <p>Kael didn’t answer. Truth was, he didn’t know if the system recognized him—or feared him.</p>
                <p>Vael studied him for a long moment.</p>
                <p>“You’re changing.”</p>
                <p>Kael nodded. “I can feel it.”</p>
                <p>His skin was warmer now, but colder inside. The Void whispered constantly. Time bent around him when he wasn’t focused. People’s emotions flickered like data points. His hands trembled not from fear—but from power.</p>
                <p>Unstable, growing.</p>
                <p>And it terrified him.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>That night, a storm tore across the frozen sky. Within the citadel’s deepest chamber, Kael followed a whisper. Not Nyra’s. Not Vael’s.</p>
                <p>A voice from the system itself.</p>
                <p>It led him to a chamber with no doors. Only a mirror.</p>
                <p>In the reflection, he didn’t see himself.</p>
                <p>He saw it.</p>
                <p>A version of Kael draped in dark armor, eyes hollow, hands soaked in blood. Behind that version were mountains of corpses—friends, enemies, innocents. And above him, the Crown of the God Signal floated, attached to his spine like a parasite.</p>
                <p>Kael backed away.</p>
                <p>The mirror cracked.</p>
                <p>Then the voice came.</p>
                <p>His throat went dry.</p>
                <p>“I don’t understand.”</p>
                <blockquote>[YOU WILL]</blockquote>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>The next day, Nyra found him staring out into the wastes.</p>
                <p>“I ran a scan,” she said, kneeling beside him. “That beacon? It’s growing. Every cycle it pulses, it syncs with another sector of the Chain.”</p>
                <p>She hesitated.</p>
                <p>“And it’s calling to people.”</p>
                <p>Kael turned sharply. “What people?”</p>
                <p>“Chain loyalists. System nodes. Even normal civilians. They're being... converted. Their thoughts change. They stop questioning orders. They worship the signal.”</p>
                <p>Kael stood, heart pounding.</p>
                <p>“It’s not just a signal. It’s a weapon.”</p>
                <p>“No,” Vael said from behind. “It’s a god. The Chain has evolved. And now it demands belief.”</p>
                <p>Kael’s hand clenched into a fist. “Then we burn it down.”</p>
                <p>Vael stepped forward, holding a shard of old tech.</p>
                <p>“There’s a place. Deep in the wastelands of Kravos Null. An ancient data vault predating even the Chain. It holds a map. One that can lead us to the Signal’s true origin.”</p>
                <p>Kael nodded. “We move at dusk.”</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>The journey through Kravos Null was a descent into madness.</p>
                <p>Storms that spoke in voices. Creatures born from corrupted data and shadow. Buildings that bled. Time loops. One hour passed, then rewound. Sometimes they found their own footprints going in circles.</p>
                <p>Kael's control faltered.</p>
                <p>The Void in him grew more sentient by the day.</p>
                <p>But still, he led them.</p>
                <p>They reached the vault after days without sleep. Its entrance was buried beneath an ancient cathedral overrun with whispering statues.</p>
                <p>Inside, everything pulsed like a heartbeat.</p>
                <p>Nyra connected her interface to the core. “Decrypting…”</p>
                <p>Then the screen flashed.</p>
                <p>Kael stepped forward as the map unlocked.</p>
                <p>It wasn’t just a place.</p>
                <p>It was a temple. Floating in orbit. Hidden inside a dead planet. And at its heart, the original God Signal.</p>
                <p>He looked at Nyra. “We’re going to space.”</p>
                <p>She gave a small, grim smile. “Then we’d better find a ship.”</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>As they prepared to leave, Kael found a final fragment of data. One not meant for anyone.</p>
                <p>It was a message.</p>
                <p>Recorded long ago.</p>
                <p>By his mother.</p>
                <p>She looked terrified. Half-mad. Her eyes were black with Void infection.</p>
                <p>“If you're seeing this, it means the Chain failed. It means you’re still alive. Good.”</p>
                <p>Her voice shook.</p>
                <p>“You’re not like them. You're not like anyone. You are not their savior, Kael. You are their undoing.”</p>
                <p>She leaned closer.</p>
                <p>“Kill the gods. Burn the sky. And if I still live…”</p>
                <p>She smiled—a cold, broken smile.</p>
                <p>“Finish what I started.”</p>
                <p>The message ended.</p>
                <p>Kael stared into the dark.</p>
                <p>And did not blink.</p>
