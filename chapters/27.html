            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The sun had not risen for six days.</p>
                <p>Not because of magic.</p>
                <p>Not because of war.</p>
                <p>But because the sky, like the world beneath it, was learning how to breathe again.</p>
                <p>Tareth Kai stood half-ruined, half-reborn. Towers shattered. Walls scorched. But from the ash, a new city was taking form—one that didn’t rely on blood-soaked hierarchies or dead kings. The balance between science, sorcery, and spirit was beginning to align for the first time in centuries.</p>
                <p>Yet even in peace, Kael could not rest.</p>
                <p>Not with the silence.</p>
                <p>Not with the weight.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>A New Enemy in the Mirror</em></p>
                <p>At the heart of the shattered Spire—a structure once known as Nyros’s dominion—Kael wandered alone. The corridors were dark, strewn with glass and bones. The void corruption was mostly gone, but echoes remained—memories suspended in dust.</p>
                <p>He reached a chamber that hadn’t existed before.</p>
                <p>A mirror stood in the center.</p>
                <p>Oval. Floating. Breathing.</p>
                <p>It pulsed with the same rhythm as the Sundered Flame once did. Kael's heartbeat slowed as he approached. His reflection didn’t match him. It was... older. Scarred. Dressed in obsidian robes and holding a blade he didn’t yet recognize.</p>
                <p>The mirror-Kael spoke.</p>
                <p>“You think the Harbinger was the end?”</p>
                <p>Kael froze.</p>
                <p>“This world is only one layer. I’ve seen them all. Some better. Some worse. And in every one, you are the key.”</p>
                <p>“I destroyed the Riftgate. I killed Nyros,” Kael muttered.</p>
                <p>The reflection chuckled. “You delayed the inevitable. The Harbinger wasn’t a god—it was a messenger.”</p>
                <p>The mirror shattered.</p>
                <p>But Kael heard the final whisper clearly:</p>
                <p>“Something worse is coming.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Gathering of the Fractured</em></p>
                <p>Lira returned that evening with scrolls recovered from the ruined libraries of the Silent Order. Her gauntlets were scratched, her eyes tired—but her mind, sharp as ever.</p>
                <p>“There are others,” she said, spreading parchments across a stone table in the reconstructed council chamber.</p>
                <p>“Other Harbingers?” Kael asked.</p>
                <p>“No. Other keys. You weren’t the only candidate. Nyros was trying to forge a singular path, but ancient prophecies mention The Eight Points of Shadow. Individuals across different lands... possibly even timelines.”</p>
                <p>Kael frowned. “You think I was just one of eight?”</p>
                <p>“Or the first,” Lira said.</p>
                <p>Jorin entered, his limp more pronounced. “We’ve got a bigger problem. Revenants have started disappearing. Not dying. Just... gone. Vanished. Left behind burn marks and strange symbols.”</p>
                <p>He tossed a scorched sigil onto the table.</p>
                <p>Kael recognized it instantly.</p>
                <p>A flame curled inside a circle of eyes.</p>
                <p>The same mark from the mirror.</p>
                <p>“Looks like your war’s not over, Kael,” Jorin muttered.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Buried Core</em></p>
                <p>They ventured south—deep into the forgotten wastelands where the first Rift had been discovered centuries ago.</p>
                <p>According to the scrolls, a hidden structure lay buried beneath obsidian sands. Some called it The Heart of the Machine. Others, The Dying God’s Eye. But all texts agreed: it was older than any known empire and possibly alive.</p>
                <p>After days of travel and sandstorms thick with hallucinations, they found it.</p>
                <p>A tower buried upside-down in the desert.</p>
                <p>Its top was sunken, its base pointing skyward like a blade stabbed into the world.</p>
                <p>Metal and bone were fused together, humming with residual energy.</p>
                <p>Inside, time bent.</p>
                <p>Lira’s voice echoed before her lips moved. Jorin's shadow refused to follow him. Kael’s thoughts appeared as whispers on the walls.</p>
                <p>But at the center, they found it:</p>
                <p>A stasis chamber.</p>
                <p>Inside—another Kael.</p>
                <p>Younger. Pale. Eyes open, but not seeing.</p>
                <p>Clutched in his hand was the same blade from the mirror.</p>
                <p>And etched into the wall behind him:</p>
                <p>"To awaken him is to begin again."</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Choices and Chains</em></p>
                <p>Lira studied the chamber. “He’s you. But not you. A version of you that never left this place.”</p>
                <p>Jorin looked uneasy. “We shouldn’t be here. This place wants something.”</p>
                <p>Kael stepped forward. The flame inside him, long dormant, flickered.</p>
                <p>The younger Kael twitched.</p>
                <p>Lira grabbed his arm. “Think. If you wake him, we don’t know what happens.”</p>
                <p>Kael stared at his other self.</p>
                <p>Then, at the sword.</p>
                <p>Then, at the wound the war had left in the sky.</p>
                <p>He reached for the stasis glass.</p>
                <p>“I don’t think I have a choice.”</p>
                <p>And as his fingers touched the surface—everything shattered.</p>
