                <p>The forest held its breath.</p>
                <p>In the deep hours of the night, before even the crickets dared to sing, a dark army approached the ruined Sacred Bloom Grove.</p>
                <p>Thousands of figures.</p>
                <p>Spirit beasts. Rogue cultivators. Assassins wearing blood-colored armor.</p>
                <p>Each step they took crushed the ground, sending ripples through the earth.</p>
                <p>Leading them was Zorath, mounted on his black dragon, a cruel smile twisting his scarred face.</p>
                <p>Behind him, banners fluttered — marked with the sigil of the Devouring Claw Alliance, a brutal organization that devoured both beast and human clans alike.</p>
                <p>They had come for one thing: The girl. The Heart of Verdant Spring.</p>
                <p>And Arjun.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Inside the Grove</em></p>
                <p>Arjun stood at the edge of the grove, silent as a statue.</p>
                <p>Beside him, Mei Ling sat cross-legged, her hands folded over the jade pendant, absorbing spirit energy from the grove’s core.</p>
                <p>Tiny vines sprouted around her, wrapping her in a cocoon of gentle green light.</p>
                <p>The old healer placed his wrinkled hand on Arjun's shoulder.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"She must not be disturbed. Her awakening is delicate."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Arjun's golden eyes narrowed, sharp and focused.</p>
                <p>He flexed his fists.</p>
                <p>Since the last battle, he had stabilized his human form better.</p>
                <p>Now he looked like a warrior out of legend: Golden-scaled boots. Eagle-like armor across his arms and chest. Two radiant wings of energy behind him, folded like blades.</p>
                <p>His hair was long and black, streaked with golden highlights, flowing in the breeze.</p>
                <p>He wasn’t fully human yet — but he was far stronger than before.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"No one will touch her," Arjun growled.</p></blockquote>
                <p>The old healer smiled faintly.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Good. Because they’re here."</p></blockquote>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The First Wave</em></p>
                <p>The enemy army didn't waste time.</p>
                <p>With a deafening roar, hundreds of spirit beasts surged forward.</p>
                <p>Wolf-beasts with flaming fangs. Boar-monsters covered in iron spikes. Shadow panthers moving faster than the eye could follow.</p>
                <p>They crashed against the grove like a tidal wave.</p>
                <p>Arjun exploded into motion.</p>
                <p>He met the first wave head-on.</p>
                <p>Fists wreathed in golden light, he struck a charging boar-beast. The impact sounded like a thunderclap — the creature's body shattered into pieces.</p>
                <p>Without pausing, he leapt into the air, wings flashing.</p>
                <p>A pack of shadow panthers tried to flank him.</p>
                <p>Arjun twisted mid-air, slicing the panthers apart with a sweep of his wings — Wind Blades shooting outward in deadly arcs.</p>
                <p>Blood rained down.</p>
                <p>Screams filled the night.</p>
                <p>But more enemies came.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Mei Ling’s Awakening</em></p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Mei Ling trembled inside her cocoon of vines.</p>
                <p>She could hear the battle. She could feel Arjun’s fierce energy protecting her.</p>
                <p>Tears slid down her cheeks.</p>
                <p>She didn’t want to be a burden.</p>
                <p>She didn’t want him to fight alone.</p>
                <p>The jade pendant pulsed.</p>
                <p>And suddenly — Power flooded into her veins.</p>
                <p>The vines around her burst apart, revealing Mei Ling standing, eyes glowing green and gold.</p>
                <p>The pendant had merged with her heart.</p>
                <p>She raised her hands.</p>
                <p>The earth answered.</p>
                <p>Thick roots erupted from the ground, wrapping around the attacking beasts, crushing them like snakes.</p>
                <p>Spirit Flowers bloomed instantly, releasing misty pollen that weakened the enemy army.</p>
                <p>The tide of battle shifted.</p>
                <p>Arjun saw her rise — strong, radiant, unafraid.</p>
                <p>For the first time, he smiled.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Good," he whispered. "Fight by my side."</p></blockquote>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Zorath Enters the Battlefield</em></p>
                <p>High above, Zorath watched the scene unfold with cold amusement.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Interesting," he said. "But insects remain insects."</p></blockquote>
                <p>He raised one massive hand.</p>
                <p>The black dragon roared, unleashing a wave of corrupted spirit fire.</p>
                <p>The fire burned not just trees — but spirit itself.</p>
                <p>Arjun’s wings flared open.</p>
                <p>He shot into the sky, meeting the fire with a blast of golden wind.</p>
                <p>The two forces collided midair, forming a cyclone of destruction.</p>
                <p>Arjun’s body glowed brighter, golden veins spreading across his skin.</p>
                <p>Zorath laughed.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You’re strong, eagle boy. Strong enough to amuse me."</p></blockquote>
                <p>He leapt off the dragon, crashing into the ground like a meteor.</p>
                <p>The earth cracked.</p>
                <p>Dust exploded outward.</p>
                <p>Zorath stood tall — easily twice the size of an average man — covered in spiked black armor, every inch of him exuding brutality.</p>
                <p>He pointed his massive sword at Arjun.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Come, protector.<br>Show me if you can stop a god of war."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Arjun, wings crackling with energy, clenched his fists.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You are no god."</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"You are nothing but another beast — about to be broken."</p></blockquote>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Clash of Titans</em></p>
                <p>The two warriors charged.</p>
                <p>The ground shattered under their feet.</p>
                <p>Their blows sent shockwaves that flattened the nearby forest.</p>
                <p>Zorath swung his black sword — wide arcs of death energy slicing through the air.</p>
                <p>Arjun ducked and weaved, countering with savage punches, each one carrying the force of a hurricane.</p>
                <p>The battle shook the heavens.</p>
                <p>Around them, Mei Ling directed her vines and spirit flowers to shield the healer and what remained of the grove.</p>
                <p>Blood soaked the ground.</p>
                <p>Bodies piled high.</p>
                <p>But Arjun would not fall.</p>
                <p>He fought like a force of nature.</p>
                <p>Like a king born from the skies.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The End of the Beginning</em></p>
                <p>Hours later, both armies were broken.</p>
                <p>Only a few stragglers remained — the rest either dead or fleeing in terror.</p>
                <p>Zorath, bleeding heavily, retreated atop his wounded dragon.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"This isn't over," he snarled. "We will meet again, Arjun. And next time... you will kneel."</p></blockquote>
                <p>With that, he vanished into the mist.</p>
                <p>Arjun, panting, watched him go.</p>
                <p>He did not chase.</p>
                <p>He knew this was only the beginning.</p>
                <p>Bigger wars awaited. Greater enemies would come.</p>
                <p>But for now... They had survived.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>A New Dawn</em></p>
                <p>The grove was ruined but alive.</p>
                <p>Spirit flowers bloomed again, slowly.</p>
                <p>The old healer wept quietly, thankful.</p>
                <p>Mei Ling approached Arjun, her small hands trembling.</p>
                <p>Without a word, she wrapped her arms around his waist, hugging him tightly.</p>
                <p>He stiffened at first — unused to such closeness — but then gently placed a hand on her head.</p>
                <p>They stood like that, bathed in the first light of the new dawn.</p>
                <p>Two survivors.</p>
                <p>Two warriors.</p>
                <p>Bound by fate.</p>
                <p>Their journey had only just begun.</p>
