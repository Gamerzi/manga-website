            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The rain came down like needles, cold and sharp, piercing the grime-covered alleys of Black Hollow.</p>
                <p>No moonlight broke through the bloated clouds.</p>
                <p>No hearths burned behind shuttered windows.</p>
                <p>The city had no place for warmth — only hunger, disease, and fear.</p>
                <p>Kaelen crouched beneath a collapsed stall, clutching his ragged cloak tighter around himself.</p>
                <p>The cloth was threadbare, but it hid the brand on his shoulder — the mark he had carried since before he could remember.</p>
                <p>A twisting spiral of black veins and silver cracks, like a wound that refused to heal.</p>
                <p>He didn’t know what it meant.</p>
                <p>Only that it made people hate him.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Thief!"</p></blockquote>
                <p>The shout echoed through the alley, close — too close.</p>
                <p>Kaelen’s muscles tensed.</p>
                <p>Instinct, sharper than thought, propelled him forward.</p>
                <p>He darted through the mud, slipping between crates and broken barrels.</p>
                <p>Behind him, heavy boots splashed after him.</p>
                <p>He had made a mistake.</p>
                <p>He knew better than to steal during the festival — when the city guards were drunk and mean.</p>
                <p>But he hadn't eaten in two days, and the baker's stall had been full of soft, steaming bread.</p>
                <p>He glanced back.</p>
                <p>Three guards. Fat with armor and clumsy with rage.</p>
                <p>Kaelen veered left, heart hammering against his ribs.</p>
                <p>He didn't stand a chance if they caught him.</p>
                <p>Boys like him — nameless, unwanted — disappeared into Black Hollow’s dungeons all the time.</p>
                <p>No one asked questions.</p>
                <p>A dead end loomed ahead — a crumbling wall, too high to climb.</p>
                <p>Panic flared.</p>
                <p>He spun, searching for an escape.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"There!"</p></blockquote>
                <p>A hand grabbed his cloak.</p>
                <p>Kaelen twisted, wrenching free, but the guard's gauntlet caught the edge of his tunic.</p>
                <p>Fabric tore.</p>
                <p>A flash of pale skin — and the brand, black and silver, pulsed in the darkness.</p>
                <p>For a moment, everything froze.</p>
                <p>The guards stared.</p>
                <p>Their anger twisted into something uglier.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"God-marked," one of them hissed.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Filthy cursed spawn."</p></blockquote>
                <p>The grip tightened around Kaelen’s throat.</p>
                <p>He kicked and struggled, but it was no use.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Should gut him here," another snarled, drawing a rusted knife.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"No one'll care."</p></blockquote>
                <p>The first guard hesitated, eyes flicking nervously around.</p>
                <p>Kaelen knew that look.</p>
                <p>Fear of the brand.</p>
                <p>Superstition ran deep in Black Hollow.</p>
                <p>Some believed the god-marked brought plagues.</p>
                <p>Others believed they brought death.</p>
                <p>Both were true, Kaelen thought bitterly.</p>
                <p>The knife flashed downward.</p>
                <p>Kaelen squeezed his eyes shut — bracing for the pain.</p>
                <blockquote><p>But the pain never came.</p></blockquote>
                <p>Instead, a low growl rumbled through the alley.</p>
                <p>A black shape lunged from the shadows — a mass of teeth and snarling fur.</p>
                <p>The guard screamed as something tore into him, dragging him backward.</p>
                <p>The others cursed and stumbled away.</p>
                <p>Kaelen fell to the ground, gasping.</p>
                <p>Through blurred vision, he saw the creature — massive, wolf-like, its eyes burning gold.</p>
                <p>It didn’t touch him.</p>
                <p>It simply stared.</p>
                <p>Then, as suddenly as it had appeared, it vanished into the rain.</p>
                <p>Kaelen staggered to his feet.</p>
                <p>The guards were gone — scattered like frightened rats.</p>
                <p>He clutched his torn cloak, pulling it tight again, and fled deeper into the maze of alleys.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>By the time he reached the ruined district, his lungs burned and his legs shook.</p>
                <p>This was the forgotten part of Black Hollow.</p>
                <p>No lanterns. No guards.</p>
                <p>Only broken stone and skeletons of buildings too stubborn to fall.</p>
                <p>Kaelen found his shelter — a half-collapsed temple, older than memory.</p>
                <p>He squeezed through the cracked door and sank to the floor.</p>
                <p>Safe.</p>
                <p>For now.</p>
                <p>The rain drummed against the shattered roof.</p>
                <p>The wind howled through empty arches.</p>
                <p>Kaelen curled up in a corner, shivering.</p>
                <p>He hated this life.</p>
                <p>The endless running, the hunger gnawing at his belly.</p>
                <p>The stares.</p>
                <p>The whispers.</p>
                <blockquote><p>Monster. Demon. Curse-bearer.</p></blockquote>
                <p>He touched the brand beneath his cloak, feeling the faint pulse of warmth.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, when he closed his eyes, he heard a voice — soft and broken, like a dying flame.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You are not alone, little ember..."</p></blockquote>
                <p>But when he opened them, there was only emptiness.</p>
                <p>Kaelen clenched his fists.</p>
                <p>He didn’t want to be a monster.</p>
                <p>He didn’t want to be cursed.</p>
                <p>He just wanted...</p>
                <p>He didn’t even know.</p>
                <p>A family?</p>
                <p>A name?</p>
                <p>Someone who saw him as more than a mark to be feared?</p>
                <p>The storm outside grew fiercer, as if answering his thoughts.</p>
                <p>Kaelen stared at the broken altar across the room — a crumbling slab of stone etched with strange runes.</p>
                <p>Once, long ago, people must have prayed here.</p>
                <p>Begged for mercy.</p>
                <p>Begged the gods to save them.</p>
                <p>The gods hadn't listened.</p>
                <p>Kaelen snorted bitterly and turned away.</p>
                <p>He didn’t believe in gods.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Somewhere in the darkness, a click echoed.</p>
                <p>Kaelen froze.</p>
                <p>Another click.</p>
                <p>Footsteps — soft, deliberate — approached.</p>
                <p>Someone was inside.</p>
                <p>He backed against the wall, heart racing.</p>
                <p>A figure emerged from the shadows — cloaked, hooded.</p>
                <p>Not a guard.</p>
                <p>Not a drunk.</p>
                <p>Something worse.</p>
                <p>A hunter.</p>
                <p>Kaelen had heard the whispers.</p>
                <p>The king’s court had begun paying bounties for the god-marked.</p>
                <p>The hooded figure raised a hand.</p>
                <p>A flicker of blue light danced between their fingers.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Come quietly," a voice said — low, smooth, almost kind.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"And you won't have to suffer."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen's mouth was dry.</p>
                <p>He had no weapon.</p>
                <p>No chance of winning.</p>
                <p>But something inside him — something ancient and furious — stirred.</p>
                <p>The brand on his shoulder burned, sending tendrils of pain down his arm.</p>
                <p>The figure took a step closer.</p>
                <p>Kaelen closed his eyes.</p>
                <p>He thought of the slums.</p>
                <p>The hunger.</p>
                <p>The hatred.</p>
                <p>The endless running.</p>
                <p>No more.</p>
                <p>The ember inside him roared to life.</p>
                <p>The air cracked.</p>
                <p>Power flooded his veins — wild, uncontrollable.</p>
                <p>The hunter recoiled, cursing.</p>
                <p>Light exploded from Kaelen's skin — white and gold and silver, blinding in the gloom.</p>
                <p>The crumbling temple shook.</p>
                <p>Dust rained from the ceiling.</p>
                <p>Kaelen screamed, but it wasn’t fear — it was something primal, something that had been trapped inside him for too long.</p>
                <p>The hunter turned and fled.</p>
                <p>The world tilted.</p>
                <p>Kaelen collapsed, the last of the power draining away.</p>
                <p>He lay there, gasping, the brand on his shoulder pulsing like a second heartbeat.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>When he woke, the storm had passed.</p>
                <p>Dawn broke through the ruined temple, pale and cold.</p>
                <p>Kaelen sat up slowly.</p>
                <p>He felt... different.</p>
                <p>Stronger.</p>
                <p>Sharper.</p>
                <p>The whisper returned, closer now — no longer broken, but fierce.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Rise, little ember."</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"The world has forgotten the old gods..."</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"But you — you will remind them."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen looked down at his hands, still faintly glowing.</p>
                <p>He didn’t know what he was.</p>
                <p>He didn’t know why he had been chosen.</p>
                <p>But he knew one thing:</p>
                <blockquote><p>He would not run anymore.</p></blockquote>
                <p>Not from the hunters.</p>
                <p>Not from the kings.</p>
                <p>Not from the broken, dying world.</p>
                <p>He would forge his own path.</p>
                <p>Even if he had to burn everything down to do it.</p>
                <p>Kaelen smiled — a small, grim thing.</p>
                <p>The boy with no name was dead.</p>
                <p>From the ashes, something new would rise.</p>
                <p>Something the world could not ignore.</p>
