            <!-- Chapter Content -->
            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The skies had changed.</p>
                <p>Where once twilight held dominion, now a storm churned in silence—lightless, vast, and unnatural. The stars had vanished, replaced by veined streaks of dark fire spiraling toward a singular void in the heavens.</p>
                <p>Kael stood on a cliff outside the Spire, his cloak whipping in the rising wind. The Riftheart’s energy still pulsed beneath his skin, humming like a second heartbeat. He felt stronger… but also watched. Every shadow tugged at his senses. Every gust whispered his name.</p>
                <p>Beside him, Lira sat cross-legged, recovering.</p>
                <p>She looked up. “So. Varok.”</p>
                <p>Kael nodded slowly. “A name even the Rift fears.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Memories That Aren’t His</em></p>
                <p>That night, Kael dreamed—or rather, relived.</p>
                <p>He stood in a world long gone. Towers of gold and crystal pierced twin suns. Cities floated above oceans of cloud. Men and women—tall, robed in star-thread—walked with gods.</p>
                <p>Kael wasn’t Kael.</p>
                <p>He was a man named Seros, a mage-lord, seated at a council where twelve thrones surrounded a dying god trapped in a crystal of frozen time.</p>
                <p>The god’s name? Varok.</p>
                <p>“He cannot be destroyed,” a voice said in Seros’ memory. “So we will scatter the keys across the streams of time. Bury his name. Shatter his image. Break the pattern.”</p>
                <p>The Riftheart was one.</p>
                <p>The Crown was another.</p>
                <p>And Kael—was the third.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Waking with Fire</em></p>
                <p>Kael jolted upright, gasping. His skin glowed faintly in the dark.</p>
                <p>Lira crouched beside him, blades drawn. “You were burning.”</p>
                <p>Kael looked at his hands. “I remember… a city in the clouds. I think I was someone else. Seros.”</p>
                <p>Lira’s face darkened. “Seros the Exile. You’ve heard the songs.”</p>
                <p>“They lied,” Kael said, standing. “He didn’t try to become a god. He tried to seal one.”</p>
                <p>“And failed.”</p>
                <p>Kael nodded. “Until now.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Broken Temple</em></p>
                <p>Their next destination lay deep in the Valley of Sighs—a temple long buried, carved into the bones of a titan slain in the First War of Flame. The air thickened as they approached—dense with static, magic, and memory.</p>
                <p>Inside, obsidian statues lined the walls—each depicting a different form of Varok: A lion-headed king. A horned serpent. A thousand-eyed child. A black flame.</p>
                <p>At the altar stood an old man in silver robes, surrounded by red runes and flickering spells. He turned slowly, revealing eyes that had no whites—only mirrors.</p>
                <p>“Seros returns,” he whispered. “But not as himself.”</p>
                <p>Kael raised a brow. “You know me?”</p>
                <p>“I am the Watcher,” the man said, smiling faintly. “Bound to remember what the world forgot.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>A Truth Unveiled</em></p>
                <p>The Watcher guided them through a hidden chamber—walls pulsing with runes that bent light and time. A mural stretched across the stone, showing Varok’s rise and fall:</p>
                <p>A golden age of peace disrupted by forbidden knowledge.</p>
                <p>A god born from fear and obsession.</p>
                <p>The betrayal of his kind.</p>
                <p>The war that followed.</p>
                <p>His imprisonment, not by might—but by memory. By erasure.</p>
                <p>“They feared Varok could not be killed,” the Watcher said, “so they ensured he could not be remembered.”</p>
                <p>Kael clenched his fists. “But he’s returning. I feel him.”</p>
                <p>“You are him,” the Watcher said gently. “Or what’s left. The piece that chose to forget.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Fury from the Past</em></p>
                <p>Before Kael could respond, the temple shook.</p>
                <p>Darkness slithered in from the walls. Shadows detached from the statues, forming armored wraiths—Voidhusks, mindless remnants of Varok’s will, drawn to Kael’s awakening power.</p>
                <p>Lira shouted, “We’ve got incoming!”</p>
                <p>Kael surged forward, the Riftlight bursting from his core. His blade burned brighter than ever—cutting through the husks like paper. But there were dozens.</p>
                <p>The Watcher whispered a chant, opening a portal back to the surface.</p>
                <p>“Go,” he urged. “You must find the fourth key. It lies in the Ruined Reach, where the gods first fell.”</p>
                <p>Kael hesitated. “What about you?”</p>
                <p>“I’ll hold them,” the Watcher said, smiling. “After all… I was waiting for this.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Escape</em></p>
                <p>Kael grabbed Lira’s hand and leapt through the portal as the temple collapsed behind them. They landed on a cold, frost-covered plain beneath a purple sky. Strange constellations lit the horizon.</p>
                <p>He looked back—but the temple was gone.</p>
                <p>Lira exhaled. “We keep running toward this… god. This thing inside you. At what point do you stop being Kael?”</p>
                <p>Kael turned, voice low.</p>
                <p>“When I stop choosing who I am.”</p>
