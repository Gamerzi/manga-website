            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The landscape beyond Sector 9G was a wasteland of twisted terrain and shimmering anomalies. Riftscars—jagged wounds in reality—flickered like mirages across the earth, humming with unstable energy. The deeper Kael, Asha, and Haron moved into the Riftline, the more the world began to blur.</p>
                <p>Trees grew in reverse. Rivers flowed in spirals. Sky and ground occasionally traded places for fleeting seconds.</p>
                <p>Time here had no loyalty.</p>
                <p>Kael could feel it gnawing at the edges of his mind—his memories playing like shattered glass on a loop. He saw his old squad. The mission he never completed. The moment he died.</p>
                <p>Or maybe almost died.</p>
                <p>Or maybe both.</p>
                <p>“How much farther?” Kael asked, sweat glistening on his brow despite the cold.</p>
                <p>Asha pointed toward the horizon, where a massive structure jutted into the sky like a jagged tooth. The Lost Spire—a fallen tower from the Pre-Rift era, rumored to be built by the Architects themselves.</p>
                <p>“It’s beneath the Spire,” Asha said. “A sanctum sealed in a temporal cocoon. Pure reality. The last of its kind.”</p>
                <p>Kael staggered. “This place… it’s wrong. I can’t tell what’s real anymore.”</p>
                <p>Haron placed a steadying hand on Kael’s shoulder. “Your power is growing. And so is the Rift’s pull on you. The sanctum is the only place you’ll be safe… for now.”</p>
                <p>They descended into the valley.</p>
                 <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>The Spire loomed above them, cracked in half, its broken top hovering weightlessly above its base, held in place by some long-forgotten magic. Glyphs still glowed faintly along the foundation—runic languages older than known history.</p>
                <p>As they stepped inside, the air shifted.</p>
                <p>The distortion vanished.</p>
                <p>Time stabilized.</p>
                <p>Kael stumbled and gasped, as if surfacing from drowning.</p>
                <p>“What… what is this place?”</p>
                <p>Asha closed her eyes. “A cradle of time. Built by those who understood how to shape reality, not just survive it.”</p>
                <p>The interior was vast and labyrinthine—circular corridors, spiral staircases suspended in midair, platforms that didn’t obey gravity.</p>
                <p>In the center was the sanctum.</p>
                <p>A massive circular chamber ringed by mirrors of glass-like crystal. At its heart stood an obsidian monolith etched with pulsating sigils, the same pattern now glowing on Kael’s chest.</p>
                <p>“This is where the first Shatterborn awakened,” Haron said quietly. “Before DeepCorp. Before the Reapers. Before the Rift had a name.”</p>
                <p>Kael approached the monolith.</p>
                <p>As he did, the entire chamber came alive. Lights pulsed, mirrors flickered with fragmented images of a thousand timelines—some he recognized, others he didn’t.</p>
                <p>In one, he saw himself as a child, laughing in a world without war.</p>
                <p>In another, he was older, pale-eyed, a tyrant ruling over burning cities.</p>
                <p>He turned away, breath shallow.</p>
                <p>“I hate this.”</p>
                <p>“You’re seeing echoes,” Haron explained. “Versions of yourself that could have been… or still might be.”</p>
                <p>Kael clenched his jaw. “Why bring me here?”</p>
                <p>Asha stepped beside him. “Because this place can anchor you. Slow the fracture. Help you reclaim control over the Rift inside you.”</p>
                <p>Haron nodded. “But it comes with a choice.”</p>
                <p>He gestured to the monolith.</p>
                <p>“You must bind yourself to one timeline. One identity. Anchor your soul. Otherwise, you’ll drift forever—becoming a creature of the Rift.”</p>
                <p>Kael hesitated. “If I do this… what do I lose?”</p>
                <p>“Everything else,” Haron said simply. “Every other version of you. Every possibility.”</p>
                <p>Kael stared at the monolith. Memories and voices tugged at him from every mirror. Some pleaded. Some screamed. One even laughed.</p>
                <p>Then he remembered that moment by the campfire.</p>
                <p>His squad. The stars. Peace.</p>
                <p>“I know who I am,” Kael said.</p>
                <p>And he touched the monolith.</p>
                 <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>The chamber exploded with light.</p>
                <p>Sigils carved themselves into the air. His body lifted off the floor, suspended in a cocoon of pure energy. The Riftmark on his chest expanded, forming an intricate web of glowing lines that covered his skin.</p>
                <p>And then…</p>
                <p>Stillness.</p>
                <p>Silence.</p>
                <p>Inside his mind, Kael stood in a field of starlight, face to face with… himself.</p>
                <p>A version of him without scars. Without rage.</p>
                <p>“You’re choosing… this life?” the other Kael asked. “With all its pain?”</p>
                <p>Kael nodded. “Because it’s real. And it’s mine.”</p>
                <p>The reflection smiled, nodded once, and faded.</p>
                <p>Kael gasped and dropped to the chamber floor. The monolith dimmed.</p>
                <p>The mirrors around him shattered.</p>
                <p>He was whole.</p>
                 <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>Haron looked impressed. “You did it.”</p>
                <p>Asha knelt beside him. “How do you feel?”</p>
                <p>Kael slowly stood. “Anchored. Like I’m not floating anymore. Like… I’m back in my body.”</p>
                <p>But the moment of peace didn’t last.</p>
                <p>A ripple ran through the chamber. The sigils on the monolith flickered. The Riftmark on Kael’s chest pulsed—erratic.</p>
                <p>“What’s happening?” Asha asked.</p>
                <p>Haron’s face darkened. “Something’s intruding. The sanctum is being breached.”</p>
                <p>Kael looked around. “I thought this place was sealed.”</p>
                <p>“It was,” Haron said grimly. “Until something powerful enough found a way to overwrite it.”</p>
                <p>The walls began to ripple. Shadows spilled from the mirrors’ remains.</p>
                <p>Figures stepped into the chamber—tall, cloaked in Riftlight, their bodies semi-transparent and shifting.</p>
                <p>Wraithborne.</p>
                <p>Creatures of failed timelines. Lost echoes made flesh.</p>
                <p>Kael’s eyes narrowed. “They followed me.”</p>
                <p>“No,” Asha said, drawing her orb. “They were summoned.”</p>
                 <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>The Wraithborne attacked.</p>
                <p>Time buckled as they moved—each step flickering through seconds past and future. They lashed out with claws made of frozen possibility, tearing at the air.</p>
                <p>Kael reacted instinctively.</p>
                <p>He bent time around his fists, meeting their blows with condensed seconds—punches that landed across multiple timelines. Each strike shattered a Wraithborne echo, dispersing it into light.</p>
                <p>Asha unleashed a storm of arcane shards, weaving through the chaos, shielding Kael with layers of kinetic fields. Haron summoned a temporal vortex, slowing the creatures’ movements to a crawl.</p>
                <p>But they kept coming.</p>
                <p>And worse… they began to merge.</p>
                <p>Dozens of Wraithborne fused into a singular monstrosity—a titan of entropy, its face a constantly shifting reflection of Kael’s own.</p>
                <p>The Riftborn Echo.</p>
                <p>It roared.</p>
                <p>Kael stood his ground. “This ends here.”</p>
                <p>He gathered every ounce of power the sanctum offered.</p>
                <p>And then he remembered what Haron said: <em>Your power comes at a cost.</em></p>
                <p>Kael took the hit.</p>
                <p>The Echo slammed into him, sending him crashing against the monolith. Pain exploded through his body.</p>
                <p>But Kael didn’t resist.</p>
                <p>He absorbed it.</p>
                <p>Took the fragmented timelines the Echo fed on… and burned them out from within.</p>
                <p>The Riftmark expanded across his back, his arms, his throat—light spilling from every inch of his skin.</p>
                <p>He raised one hand.</p>
                <p>Spoke one word.</p>
                <p>“Collapse.”</p>
                <p>The Echo froze.</p>
                <p>And shattered—pulled into a black hole of its own instability.</p>
                <p>The sanctum fell silent.</p>
                 <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>Kael collapsed to his knees.</p>
                <p>His vision swam.</p>
                <p>Asha rushed to his side. “Kael!”</p>
                <p>“I’m okay,” he muttered. “I think I just killed a version of myself that hated me.”</p>
                <p>Haron approached, his expression grim. “You did more than that. You sent a message—to every echo, every version of yourself that’s still wandering the Rift.”</p>
                <p>Kael looked up.</p>
                <p>“What message?”</p>
                <p>“That this Kael Draven has chosen who he is. And he’s coming for them.”</p>
                 <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p><em>Meanwhile, far beyond the Riftline…</em></p>
                <p><em>The woman in Null regalia watched the readings from the sanctum spike, then vanish.</em></p>
                <p><em>Her assistant whispered, “He stabilized. And destroyed an Echo.”</em></p>
                <p><em>The woman didn’t look away.</em></p>
                <p><em>“He’s becoming dangerous.”</em></p>
                <p><em>“What should we do?”</em></p>
                <p><em>Her eyes glowed.</em></p>
                <p><em>“Send the Revenant.”</em></p>
