                <p>The Syndicate Tower burned like a beacon.</p>
                <p>Kael Draven stood atop the jagged ruin, the Riftstorm raging around him in a furious spiral. It should have been chaos without the Protocol's control — and yet, the energies now flowed naturally, untethered, wild but alive. The souls he had freed whispered through the wind, no longer imprisoned in machines or forgotten vaults.</p>
                <p>It was over.</p>
                <p>At least, this battle was.</p>
                <p>But Kael knew victory came at a price.</p>
                <p>His body trembled from the strain of wielding the full Rift anchor. His vision blurred at the edges, colors bleeding into one another. The sigil on his forearm — once pulsing with tight, regulated patterns — now unraveled freely, alive with chaotic glyphs that shifted with his emotions.</p>
                <p>Vex’s voice crackled in his comm again, strained and distant.</p>
                <p>“Kael, the upper sectors are destabilizing. You need to get out of there. Now.”</p>
                <p>He didn’t move yet.</p>
                <p>Something held him to this place.</p>
                <p>A memory.</p>
                <p>A promise.</p>
                <p>Wren’s voice echoed faintly in his mind: "We were never meant to be weapons. Just... people."</p>
                <p>Kael closed his eyes against the biting wind.</p>
                <p>He hadn’t saved the world tonight.</p>
                <p>He had only broken its shackles.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p><strong>Hours later — The Ruins of Sector Zero</strong></p>
                <p>Dawn bled over the shattered skyline.</p>
                <p>Kael moved through the wreckage like a ghost, cloak torn, armor scorched. No Syndicate enforcers hunted him now; their chain of command had collapsed with Vale’s death. Scattered across the city, rogue elements either fled or fought among themselves for scraps of old power.</p>
                <p>The people — the ones who’d lived under the Syndicate’s silent boot — began emerging from hiding. Survivors. Witnesses. Some looked at Kael with fear. Others with awe. But he didn’t want either.</p>
                <p>He wasn’t a hero.</p>
                <p>He was simply... free.</p>
                <p>At a broken intersection, a battered skimmer glided toward him.</p>
                <p>The cockpit opened, and Vex leaned out, eyes wide.</p>
                <p>“You look like hell.”</p>
                <p>Kael managed a tired smirk. “Feel worse.”</p>
                <p>She tossed him a canteen. “Drink. You’re not allowed to die after all that."</p>
                <p>He caught it, taking a grateful sip. Water tasted sharper after Riftburn — like drinking a memory — but it grounded him.</p>
                <p>Vex stepped down beside him, scanning the devastated tower.</p>
                <p>“So it’s really over?” she asked quietly.</p>
                <p>Kael shook his head. “Over for them. Not for us.”</p>
                <p>She tilted her head. “Meaning?”</p>
                <p>Kael gestured to the horizon, where Riftstorms still flickered in the distance, unstable zones rippling where the Syndicate’s machinery had broken apart.</p>
                <p>“The Rift’s still open. Still leaking. Without their control systems, it’s... unpredictable. Dangerous.”</p>
                <p>He looked her dead in the eye.</p>
                <p>“We either find a way to stabilize it... or the world ends slower than Vale planned.”</p>
                <p>Vex gave a long, low whistle. “And here I was hoping for a vacation.”</p>
                <p>Kael chuckled — the sound raw, rare.</p>
                <p>“We’re not alone,” he added. “The ones we freed... they’re still out there. Lost. Some might be able to help. Others...” His gaze hardened. “Others won’t know who they are anymore.”</p>
                <p>Vex nodded slowly. “We’ll need allies.”</p>
                <p>Kael thought of the Hollow Warden — the ancient presence that had whispered guidance. Of Wren, now one with the Rift’s spirit. Of the thousands of broken minds now adrift between worlds.</p>
                <p>“We’ll need more than that,” he said.</p>
                <p>“We’ll need a new world.”</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p><strong>Later — Beneath the Ashen Skies</strong></p>
                <p>They made their camp in what used to be a marketplace — now just blackened stalls and skeletal steel frames. Kael sat near the fire Vex had managed to coax from twisted debris.</p>
                <p>Around them, the city groaned as it tried to breathe again.</p>
                <p>Kael unrolled a faded map across the cracked stone.</p>
                <p>Vex leaned over his shoulder. “Planning something?”</p>
                <p>He pointed at several sectors, ones where Rift-energy bled brightest.</p>
                <p>“These are epicenters. Ground zeroes. If we can establish anchors in these zones...”</p>
                <p>“Like the one you carry?”</p>
                <p>Kael nodded. “It could bind the Rift fractures. Heal them. Maybe even rebuild the Veil between worlds.”</p>
                <p>Vex whistled. “Sounds... insanely impossible.”</p>
                <p>He smiled grimly. “Good. Means it might actually work.”</p>
                <p>A shadow fell over the map.</p>
                <p>Another figure stepped out of the mist — a young woman, spectral and translucent. At first, Kael reached for his weapon instinctively — then he paused.</p>
                <p>The woman bowed her head. No threat.</p>
                <p>One of the freed souls.</p>
                <p>More began to appear — flickers of human forms made of light and ash. Some wore uniforms of ancient wars; others, simple civilian clothes, their faces weary but alive with something long lost:</p>
                <p>Hope.</p>
                <p>Vex stood, backing away slightly. “Uh... Kael?”</p>
                <p>He rose slowly, facing the gathering spirits.</p>
                <p>They said nothing, but he felt them — waiting, watching.</p>
                <p>Not enemies.</p>
                <p>Not ghosts.</p>
                <p>Witnesses.</p>
                <p>Kael raised his voice, hoarse but steady.</p>
                <p>"I broke your chains. I can’t fix everything. But I will give you a choice."</p>
                <p>He planted his sword in the stone, a beacon of Riftlight.</p>
                <p>"You can fade, free at last. Or you can stand with me. Help me rebuild what they tried to destroy."</p>
                <p>The spirits didn’t speak.</p>
                <p>But the Rift pulsed once — a deep, resonant sound — and several of the souls solidified slightly, drawing closer to the light.</p>
                <p>Choosing.</p>
                <p>Vex stared in awe. "You're building an army of the dead."</p>
                <p>Kael shook his head.</p>
                <p>"An army of the forgotten."</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p><strong>Dawn — The First Requiem</strong></p>
                <p>By the time the sun tore through the storm clouds, Kael and Vex were no longer alone.</p>
                <p>A hundred spirits marched with them, their forms woven from Riftlight and memory. Behind them, the broken city watched — fearful, yes — but also filled with a flicker of something dangerous:</p>
                <p>Belief.</p>
                <p>Kael turned his gaze to the horizon, where Riftstorms still boiled against the waking world.</p>
                <p>A war was coming.</p>
                <p>Not against flesh and blood.</p>
                <p>But against the memory of oppression.</p>
                <p>The Syndicate was dead.</p>
                <p>But the Arcane Protocol had only just begun — and Kael Draven would be its final author.</p>
                <p>He lifted his blade.</p>
                <p>And the world, battered and broken, lifted its face toward him — toward the first true dawn it had seen in a century.</p>
                <p>The requiem had ended.</p>
                <p>Now came the rebirth.</p>
                <p><strong>End of Chapter 8</strong></p>
