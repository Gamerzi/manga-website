            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>By midmorning, Black Hollow’s streets had returned to their usual state of slow rot.</p>
                <p>Merchants barked half-heartedly about spoiled goods.</p>
                <p>Pickpockets weaved through the crowds, hands faster than the eye.</p>
                <p>The smell of smoke and sewage clung to everything.</p>
                <p>Kaelen moved through it like a ghost.</p>
                <p>The torn cloak hung loosely from his shoulders, hiding the brand still throbbing against his skin.</p>
                <p>The strange power that had exploded from him the night before now sat dormant, a heavy presence at the edge of his mind.</p>
                <p>He needed to get out of the city.</p>
                <p>Fast.</p>
                <p>The hunter’s retreat wouldn't go unnoticed for long.</p>
                <p>If word spread — if the bounty hunters or worse, the king's enforcers, learned what he could do — Black Hollow would turn into a slaughterhouse.</p>
                <p>Not that it wasn’t halfway there already.</p>
                <p>Kaelen kept to the narrowest alleys, the ones so tight even rats thought twice.</p>
                <p>He moved through the Lower Wards, past crumbling statues of gods no one remembered, past rotted temples and ash-covered plazas.</p>
                <p>He had a plan.</p>
                <p>Sort of.</p>
                <p>There was a smuggler’s gate — hidden beneath the old market square — where the desperate paid blood and coin for passage out of the city.</p>
                <p>He had no coin.</p>
                <p>But he had blood, and he wasn’t above spilling it.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>The square was emptier than usual when he arrived.</p>
                <p>Most stalls were abandoned, left to rot under the gray sky.</p>
                <p>At the center stood the old fountain — dry for decades, the stone wolves chipped and moss-covered.</p>
                <p>Kaelen approached cautiously.</p>
                <p>A man lounged against the fountain's base — tall, lean, wrapped in a red-dusted cloak.</p>
                <p>An eye-patch covered his left eye, and his grin was all sharp teeth.</p>
                <p>Kaelen recognized him instantly: Ravik, the "Keeper of the Gate."</p>
                <p>Rumors said Ravik had once been a knight.</p>
                <p>Others said he had butchered his own lord and drunk his blood.</p>
                <p>Either way, he controlled who slipped in and out of Black Hollow unseen.</p>
                <p>And he didn’t work for free.</p>
                <p>Ravik's single eye gleamed as Kaelen approached.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Well, well," he drawled. "What’s this? A little mouse out in the open? How brave."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen stayed silent.</p>
                <p>He pulled back his hood just enough for Ravik to see the faint outline of the brand on his collarbone.</p>
                <p>The smile vanished from the man's face.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You’re god-marked," Ravik muttered, voice tight with unease.</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen nodded.</p>
                <p>No point lying.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"I need passage," he said. "Tonight."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Ravik stared at him a long moment.</p>
                <p>Then he laughed — a harsh, barking sound.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You’ve got no coin. No friends. No leverage."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen said nothing.</p>
                <p>The air between them grew heavy.</p>
                <p>Ravik shifted, his hand moving toward the dagger at his belt.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You’re worth more dead than alive, boy. Lot of people would pay good silver for a pretty little corpse like you."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen’s fingers twitched at his side.</p>
                <p>The power stirred inside him again — a slow-burning coal.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You can try," Kaelen said softly.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"But you won’t live long enough to spend it."</p></blockquote>
                <p>For a heartbeat, Ravik hesitated.</p>
                <p>Then he smiled again — not mocking this time, but something sharper. Respect.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Feisty. I like it."</p></blockquote>
                <p>He spat to the side and jerked his head toward a cracked doorway behind the fountain.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Go through there. Follow the stairs down. Tell Grent I sent you."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen nodded once.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"But," Ravik added, voice like steel, "if you bring heat down on us — if hunters follow your trail — we’ll gut you and leave your bones for the crows."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Fair enough, Kaelen thought grimly.</p>
                <p>He slipped through the doorway without another word.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>The stairs spiraled deep underground, lit only by sputtering torches jammed into crumbling walls.</p>
                <p>At the bottom waited a heavy iron gate and a man as broad as a horse — Grent, no doubt.</p>
                <p>He eyed Kaelen suspiciously but said nothing as he opened the gate.</p>
                <p>Beyond lay an ancient tunnel, half-collapsed, filled with the stink of mold and something worse.</p>
                <p>Kaelen hurried through.</p>
                <p>The tunnel twisted and writhed like a dying snake, leading away from the city’s heart toward the outer districts — the Graveyard Rows.</p>
                <p>Black Hollow didn’t bury its dead.</p>
                <p>It threw them outside the walls, where the soil was too cursed for anything to grow.</p>
                <p>Kaelen emerged into gray light and immediately gagged.</p>
                <p>The air was thick with rot and buzzing flies.</p>
                <p>Mounds of old bones and broken bodies stretched for miles.</p>
                <p>Welcome to freedom.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>He didn't make it twenty steps before they found him.</p>
                <p>Figures rose from behind a heap of corpses — cloaked and masked.</p>
                <p>Five of them.</p>
                <p>Their blades gleamed dully in the gloom.</p>
                <p>Kaelen cursed under his breath.</p>
                <p>Hunters.</p>
                <p>Ravik must have sold him out — or someone had followed him despite everything.</p>
                <p>The leader stepped forward, voice muffled by a steel mask.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"By decree of His Majesty, bearer of the god-mark — surrender."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen straightened slowly.</p>
                <p>He could feel the ember inside him, crackling like lightning in his veins.</p>
                <p>Not yet.</p>
                <p>Not until he had no choice.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"I have nothing you want," Kaelen said.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Walk away."</p></blockquote>
                <p>The hunters laughed — cold, humorless.</p>
                <p>One of them lunged.</p>
                <p>Kaelen moved.</p>
                <p>The ember surged through him, warping the world into sharp clarity.</p>
                <p>He ducked the sword swing, seized the man's wrist, and burned.</p>
                <p>The hunter screamed as white fire raced along his arm, searing flesh and melting steel.</p>
                <p>Kaelen threw him aside like a rag doll.</p>
                <p>The others hesitated — but only for a moment.</p>
                <p>They attacked as one.</p>
                <p>Kaelen fought like a cornered animal, every movement instinct and desperation.</p>
                <p>The world narrowed to flashes of steel and bursts of light.</p>
                <p>A dagger grazed his side — pain blossomed, sharp and hot.</p>
                <p>Another sword tore across his cloak — the fabric blackened and peeled away.</p>
                <p>Kaelen snarled, shoving his bleeding hand into the ground.</p>
                <blockquote><p>The earth answered.</p></blockquote>
                <p>A ring of fire erupted around him, forcing the hunters back.</p>
                <p>For a heartbeat, they hesitated — fear creeping in.</p>
                <p>Then the leader barked a command, and they charged again.</p>
                <p>Kaelen was ready.</p>
                <p>He drew on the ember fully this time — no restraint, no fear.</p>
                <p>A shockwave of burning silver light exploded outward.</p>
                <p>The nearest hunter caught the brunt of it and disintegrated — flesh and bone reduced to ash.</p>
                <p>The others stumbled, shielding their faces.</p>
                <p>Kaelen pressed the advantage.</p>
                <p>He moved like a storm — fast, merciless.</p>
                <p>When it was over, he stood alone among smoldering corpses.</p>
                <p>His chest heaved.</p>
                <p>His wounds burned.</p>
                <p>The Graveyard Rows were silent again, except for the buzzing of flies.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Kaelen dropped to one knee, gasping for breath.</p>
                <p>The power had saved him — but it was wild, uncontrollable.</p>
                <p>If he didn’t learn to master it...</p>
                <p>It would kill him just as surely as any blade.</p>
                <p>He rose slowly.</p>
                <p>The road ahead stretched empty and gray, leading into the desolate hills beyond Black Hollow.</p>
                <p>Somewhere out there, he would find answers.</p>
                <p>He had to.</p>
                <p>Because the king wouldn't stop.</p>
                <p>The hunters wouldn't stop.</p>
                <p>The world itself seemed set against him.</p>
                <p>But Kaelen was done running.</p>
                <p>From now on, the world would run from him.</p>
                <p>He pulled the remnants of his cloak tighter around his shoulders and walked into the ash-blown wind, eyes set on the horizon.</p>
