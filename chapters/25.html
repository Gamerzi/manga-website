            <!-- Chapter Content -->
            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The skies over the continent of Virel had turned a permanent shade of storm-wrought gray. Lightning arched like serpents over the highlands, and the air itself carried the scent of ozone and decay. From the remnants of the shattered Watcher’s Peak, Kael looked down upon a world preparing to die.</p>
                <p>At the heart of the valley, the final Riftgate had opened.</p>
                <p>It wasn’t like the others. This one pulsed with blackened light—folding the air around it like a broken mirror. Ancient glyphs flickered in and out of reality, and through the arch of it, a massive shape loomed. Slumbering… but awakening.</p>
                <p>Nyros’s voice boomed from the spires he’d erected beside the gate, laced with command spells and tethered to the bones of sacrificed sages.</p>
                <p>“Come forth, Harbinger. Let the forgotten become flesh.”</p>
                <p>Kael’s blood turned cold. He recognized the creature beyond the veil—not from scrolls or stories, but from the Dreamforge itself. A name etched into the deepest vaults of time:</p>
                <p>Aeryzeth. The First Cataclysm.</p>
                <p>Not even a god.</p>
                <p>Something older.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Gathering the Broken</em></p>
                <p>Back in the city of Tareth Kai, now serving as the stronghold of the rebellion, the newly freed Revenants helped fortify walls of kinetic stone. Massive glyph-cannons were mounted along battlements, manned by arch-scribes who had abandoned Nyros’s empire.</p>
                <p>Lira paced alongside Kael through a corridor of softly glowing orbs, each one containing fragments of prophecy stolen from the enemy.</p>
                <p>“We’re not ready,” she said.</p>
                <p>Kael didn’t answer. His mind was elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Jorin had taken a group of Revenants to scout the edge of the Riftgate, but communications had gone silent. Either the magic interference was too strong… or they were dead.</p>
                <p>“We’ll never be ready,” Kael finally said. “This isn’t a war. It’s a reckoning.”</p>
                <p>“But we still fight,” Lira added.</p>
                <p>He nodded.</p>
                <p>They entered the inner sanctum where the surviving members of the Eight Orders awaited—a ragtag assembly of ancient mystics, mech-magi, and spellforged warriors.</p>
                <p>“The enemy has summoned the Harbinger,” Kael announced. “This isn’t about empires anymore. This is about extinction.”</p>
                <p>The old priest of the Ashen Choir leaned forward. “Then we must awaken the World Beneath.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Secrets Buried in the Earth</em></p>
                <p>Long before the gods, before even the first Rift split the skies, there was another world—hidden, protected, and forgotten. The World Beneath Ash. A sub-layer of reality formed when the Titans waged war with the stars and broke time itself.</p>
                <p>Few had ever seen it.</p>
                <p>Fewer had returned.</p>
                <p>But if it still existed… it contained weapons of a different kind: truths. Pure, unfiltered, and dangerous.</p>
                <p>Kael, Lira, and a small group descended deep under Tareth Kai through vaults sealed by thought and memory. Jorin joined them mid-journey, wounded but alive.</p>
                <p>“We lost ten. But the Harbinger hasn’t crossed through yet. It’s... watching. Waiting.”</p>
                <p>“Then we have time,” Kael said grimly. “Not much, but enough.”</p>
                <p>They reached a gate of living stone—a door with no hinges, no locks, just a surface that refused to be real.</p>
                <p>Kael stepped forward, and it recognized him.</p>
                <p>The Riftheart in his chest pulsed. Velthren’s fragment whispered.</p>
                <p>“Beyond lies the echo of creation,” it said. “And the price of knowing.”</p>
                <p>Kael touched the door.</p>
                <p>It opened.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Dead City of Kharix</em></p>
                <p>Inside was darkness. But not absence.</p>
                <p>Presence.</p>
                <p>Every wall shimmered with inscriptions written by beings who had no mouths. The air pulsed with silent hymns. And at the heart of the World Beneath… was Kharix.</p>
                <p>A city made of crystallized memory.</p>
                <p>No lights.</p>
                <p>But it glowed.</p>
                <p>Figures watched them from balconies—shades of the past, wrapped in dreamcloth, speaking in tongues that echoed backward.</p>
                <p>Kael walked ahead as if pulled by a thread.</p>
                <p>They reached the central chamber, where a sphere of perfectly still liquid floated above an obsidian pedestal. Within it swirled the future—and the past—converging.</p>
                <p>Kael reached out.</p>
                <p>And the world cracked.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Visions and Warnings</em></p>
                <p>He stood on a battlefield of unwritten time.</p>
                <p>Aeryzeth hovered in the sky—no shape, just presence—devouring stars with silent fury. Below, Nyros held a crown of flame in one hand, and a corpse in the other.</p>
                <p>Kael’s corpse.</p>
                <p>Then Velthren appeared beside him, not as a man, but as an idea. Shifting form, still and fluid.</p>
                <p>“You are the knife.”</p>
                <p>“What?”</p>
                <p>“The knife between two futures. Nyros seeks to unmake the world so he can write it from scratch. Aeryzeth will consume it all. You… must choose which one to stop.”</p>
                <p>“Why not both?”</p>
                <p>“Because stopping both means killing the world as it is.”</p>
                <p>Kael clenched his fists. “Then I’ll rewrite it myself.”</p>
                <p>Velthren nodded. “Then awaken the Sundered Flame.”</p>
                <p>Kael gasped, falling back into his body.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Weapon That Wasn't</em></p>
                <p>The “Sundered Flame” was not a sword, or spell, or even a person.</p>
                <p>It was a choice.</p>
                <p>A paradox weapon left behind by the Makers. It required the wielder to sacrifice what they loved most—and in return, it would undo one great truth.</p>
                <p>Kael staggered to his feet, breath heavy.</p>
                <p>“What happened?” Lira asked.</p>
                <p>Kael turned slowly, eyes haunted.</p>
                <p>“I know how to stop them.”</p>
                <p>Jorin looked up. “What’s the cost?”</p>
                <p>Kael didn’t answer.</p>
                <p>He already knew.</p>
                <p>It was her.</p>
                <p>Lira.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>March of the Harbinger</em></p>
                <p>They returned to the surface as the ground trembled.</p>
                <p>Aeryzeth had crossed through.</p>
                <p>It floated miles above the earth, trailing whispers that turned cities to dust and oceans to black glass. Where it passed, time bent. Birds froze mid-flight. Trees aged into dust.</p>
                <p>And beneath it, Nyros stood atop a throne of broken gods, smiling.</p>
                <p>His army—vast, reanimated, and relentless—marched across the plains toward Tareth Kai.</p>
                <p>Kael turned to his allies. “This is it.”</p>
                <p>The old Orders lit their sigils.</p>
                <p>The Revenants readied their blades.</p>
                <p>Lira stood beside Kael, eyes fierce. “One way or another…”</p>
                <p>“We end this,” Kael finished.</p>
                <p>And as the first wave of Nyros’s forces hit the outer wall, Kael stepped into the storm—carrying a flame that could either save the world… or burn it to ash.</p>
