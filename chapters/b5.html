            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The Sacred Bloom Grove was a place of peace. But tonight, it would become a battlefield.</p>
                <p>The air crackled with unseen tension. The glowing spirit flowers shivered, their petals curling inward as if sensing the bloodshed to come.</p>
                <p>Arjun stood at the center of the clearing, wings half-spread, golden feathers reflecting the faint light of the healing lotus where the girl lay.</p>
                <p>His sharp eyes scanned the darkened forest.</p>
                <p><em>They're here.</em></p>
                <p>He could feel them — dozens of killing intents, cold and sharp as daggers, slithering toward the clearing from every direction.</p>
                <p>The assassins of the Black Fang Society. Experts in silent death. Hunters of beasts and men alike.</p>
                <p>They had come prepared.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>First Blood</em></p>
                <p>The first attacker moved like a shadow — a thin figure dressed entirely in black, mask covering his face, blades glinting faintly in both hands.</p>
                <p>Without a sound, he leaped from the treetops, aiming for the unconscious girl.</p>
                <p>Arjun reacted instantly.</p>
                <p>With a single flap of his massive wings, he blasted a shockwave outward, uprooting bushes and sending the assassin tumbling midair.</p>
                <p>Before the man could recover, Arjun was upon him.</p>
                <p>A blur of golden fury.</p>
                <p>One talon slashed downward — a clean, brutal strike — and the assassin's body hit the ground in two broken halves.</p>
                <p>Blood soaked the earth.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>From the trees, other assassins hissed commands.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Attack together!"</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Bind his wings!"</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Poison the beast if you must!"</p></blockquote>
                <p>Dozens of figures surged forward, brandishing nets woven with spiritual energy, daggers coated in black venom, chains that pulsed with sealing runes.</p>
                <p>Arjun's heart pounded.</p>
                <p>He could not afford to let a single one of them near the girl.</p>
                <p>He roared — a deep, thunderous sound that shook the very trees.</p>
                <p>The spirit beasts of the grove — the foxes, the rabbits, the serpents — scattered in fear.</p>
                <p>But the old healer remained where he sat by the lotus blossom, eyes closed in deep meditation, maintaining the fragile healing ritual.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You must hold, golden one," the healer murmured without looking. "For if she dies, so does your chance."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Chance? Chance at what?</p>
                <p>Arjun had no time to ask.</p>
                <p>The assassins struck.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Dance of Death</em></p>
                <p>The first wave came fast — Three assassins from the left, two from the right, one from directly above.</p>
                <p>They coordinated perfectly, as if sharing a single murderous mind.</p>
                <p>But Arjun was faster.</p>
                <p>He pivoted sharply, wings slicing through the air with deadly precision. His left wing clipped one attacker mid-leap, sending him crashing into a thorned tree.</p>
                <p>He ducked under a poisoned chain, talons crushing the ribcage of a masked killer who got too close.</p>
                <p>Above, a rain of throwing knives descended.</p>
                <p>Arjun spun — Golden feathers shot outward like darts of light, intercepting the knives midair, deflecting them harmlessly into the dirt.</p>
                <p>But there were too many enemies.</p>
                <p>Chains wrapped around his left wing, yanking hard.</p>
                <p>Arjun shrieked in fury, pulling with all his strength.</p>
                <p>Muscles strained.</p>
                <p>Feathers tore.</p>
                <p>But he refused to fall.</p>
                <p>With a savage jerk, he dragged the chain-bearers closer — and slammed them together with a bone-breaking crash.</p>
                <p>Two more enemies dead.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>But not all enemies fought with steel.</p>
                <p>From the treeline, a woman in red robes chanted low and fast, her hands weaving complex sigils in the air.</p>
                <p>Dark smoke rose from the ground, twisting into the form of a giant shadow serpent.</p>
                <p>The serpent lunged, fangs wide, aiming for the healing lotus.</p>
                <p>Arjun's eyes blazed.</p>
                <p>No magic would touch her while he breathed.</p>
                <p>He launched himself forward — crashing into the serpent with a force like a falling mountain.</p>
                <p>The illusion shattered with a howl — but the backlash of spiritual energy rocked Arjun, making him stagger.</p>
                <p>Blood trickled from his beak.</p>
                <p>He was strong — far stronger…</p>
