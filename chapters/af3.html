                <p>The obsidian blade sliced through the air like a guillotine.</p>
                <p>He barely ducked in time.</p>
                <p>The woman in the bone mask moved with terrifying grace. Her sword kissed the stone behind him, cleaving it like parchment. No wasted motion. No hesitation. Every swing was a question: Do you deserve to live?</p>
                <p>He answered with movement.</p>
                <p>A roll, a dodge, a counter—but her blade was always a breath ahead.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>He slid under a slash and sprang back, chest heaving. Blood dripped from a shallow cut across his shoulder, hissing faintly as it touched the ground.</p>
                <p>Her blade was alive.</p>
                <p>“You’re fast,” she said, circling. Her voice echoed in the ruined cathedral like a requiem. “But you fight like prey.”</p>
                <p>“I’ve killed Dominion enforcers,” he snarled.</p>
                <p>She laughed.</p>
                <p>“I’ve trained them.”</p>
                <p>Then she came again.</p>
                <p>He activated Echo Vein—but something was off. His vision blurred at the edges. His nerves twitched. Too soon after the last fight. The system wasn’t fully stabilized.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>He fought anyway.</p>
                <p>Every movement became instinct. A pivot here, a parry there. But she read him. Anticipated. Her foot landed squarely in his ribs, throwing him against a crumbling pillar.</p>
                <p>He coughed blood. The world spun.</p>
                <p>She stalked toward him, lowering her sword.</p>
                <p>“Most Godmarked don’t survive their first combat,” she said. “Even fewer survive their first awakening. You’ve done both. But that’s not enough.”</p>
                <p>She knelt beside him.</p>
                <p>“Power’s easy. It’s will that matters.”</p>
                <p>He tried to rise. She planted the blade beside his neck.</p>
                <p>“Tell me your name.”</p>
                <p>He hesitated.</p>
                <p>“I don’t have one.”</p>
                <p>“Wrong answer.”</p>
                <p>She backhanded him across the face. Pain flared white.</p>
                <p>“You do now,” she said. “You’re Ash. Born of ruin. Tempered by flame.”</p>
                <p>He blinked. “Ash…”</p>
                <p>“You want to live, Ash? Then fight like someone who’s already dead.”</p>
                <p>She stood, turning her back to him.</p>
                <p>“That was your test. You failed. But you failed loudly. That means they heard.”</p>
                <p>“Who?”</p>
                <p>She didn’t answer.</p>
                <p>A distant tremor rattled the cathedral floor.</p>
                <p>“Protocol 006,” the system whispered in his mind. “Aberrant Presence Detected.”</p>
                <p>Ash staggered to his feet.</p>
                <p>Far above them, beyond the shattered dome, the sky turned black—not from clouds, but from wings.</p>
                <p>Dozens of them.</p>
                <p>Creatures born from Abyssal fractures. Hulking, horned, leathery-skinned. Beasts that hadn’t seen daylight in a century.</p>
                <p>“Did you lead them here?” he gasped.</p>
                <p>She smirked behind the mask.</p>
                <p>“No. You did. When you killed those enforcers.”</p>
                <p>Ash’s blood went cold.</p>
                <p>“They were tagged?”</p>
                <p>“Every Dominion officer carries an Abyssal trace. You bled three. That scent doesn’t fade.”</p>
                <p>The sky split with shrieks.</p>
                <p>The woman threw him a small device—metallic, etched with sigils.</p>
                <p>“Abyss pulse bomb,” she said. “Will stun them. Ten-second delay. Get clear or get shredded.”</p>
                <p>She leapt toward the cathedral’s upper level as the first winged beast dropped through the broken ceiling.</p>
                <p>Ash turned, gripping the bomb.</p>
                <p>It looked like nothing. A toy.</p>
                <p>But the runes were hot.</p>
                <p>The system flared again:</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>“Let’s see what you’re hiding,” he whispered.</p>
                <p>He activated Pulse Sync.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>He smiled through the blood.</p>
                <p>“NO.”</p>
                <p>He threw the bomb high.</p>
                <p>The creature lunged for him, jaws open wide—</p>
                <p>And the sky exploded.</p>
                <p>The bomb lit the cathedral like a second sun. Sound vanished. The wave hit like a sledgehammer. Ash flew back, bones rattling, air ripped from his lungs.</p>
                <p>When he opened his eyes, the cathedral was gone.</p>
                <p>The beasts were ash.</p>
                <p>Smoke rolled through the ruin.</p>
                <p>And in the distance, a siren wailed.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>The woman in the mask appeared beside him, untouched by the blast.</p>
                <p>“You’re lucky,” she said. “You should be dead.”</p>
                <p>“I get that a lot.”</p>
                <p>She studied him.</p>
                <p>“I could train you. If you don’t die first.”</p>
                <p>He met her eyes.</p>
                <p>“I don’t plan to.”</p>
                <p>Her gaze sharpened.</p>
                <p>“You’ll need more than plans. You’ll need blood. Sacrifice. And you’ll need to understand what it means to be Godmarked.”</p>
                <p>Ash breathed in the sulfur-smoked air.</p>
                <p>And for the first time… he smiled.</p>
