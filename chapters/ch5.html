            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The moment Ashwake crossed the threshold, reality twisted.</p>
                <p>Stars vanished.</p>
                <p>Time slowed.</p>
                <p>And the universe itself seemed to hold its breath.</p>
                <p>The portal behind them collapsed in silence. There was no turning back.</p>
                <p>Before them floated the Temple of the First Signal—a monstrous, cathedral-like structure coiled in the remains of a shattered moon. Its spires jutted into a sky that didn’t exist, its surface carved with circuitry that bled faint crimson light. The Temple wasn’t built. It had been grown, like a cancer in space.</p>
                <p>Kael stared through the ship’s fractured viewport, and for the first time in weeks… he felt fear.</p>
                <p>This place wasn’t just old.</p>
                <p>It was eternal.</p>
                <p>“System’s dead,” Nyra muttered, tapping uselessly at the controls. “No signals. No stars. No data. Just… the Temple.”</p>
                <p>Vael strapped his rifle to his back, jaw clenched. “We walk from here.”</p>
                <p>Kael didn’t move. He stared at the spires.</p>
                <p>“I hear it,” he whispered.</p>
                <p>Nyra looked up. “Hear what?”</p>
                <p>Kael turned slowly, eyes darker than before.</p>
                <p>“The God that isn’t dead.”</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>As they stepped onto the Temple’s outer walkway, gravity shifted—then obeyed. The structure seemed to respond to their presence, pulling them inward. No oxygen, no atmosphere, yet they could breathe. Could speak.</p>
                <p>The laws of physics didn’t die here.</p>
                <p>They obeyed.</p>
                <p>The corridors inside were alive—sinew and stone, data and bone merged into one. Black crystal lined the walls, echoing with the sounds of memories that weren’t theirs. A child crying. A man praying. A scream that never stopped.</p>
                <p>They descended.</p>
                <p>Room by room, chamber by chamber.</p>
                <p>Each passage was a scar in the fabric of time, and Kael’s mark grew brighter the deeper they went.</p>
                <p>“This was never a station,” he muttered. “It was a womb.”</p>
                <p>Nyra raised an eyebrow. “For what?”</p>
                <p>Kael didn’t answer.</p>
                <p>Because he knew.</p>
                <p>And he didn’t want to say it aloud.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>They reached the Core Sanctum.</p>
                <p>A circular arena, surrounded by hundreds of thrones—each occupied by a husk. Not machines. Not entirely human. Just remnants—each bearing a different version of the God-mark.</p>
                <p>Vael whispered, “What the hell are they?”</p>
                <p>“Failed Chosen,” Kael replied. “This was a crucible.”</p>
                <p>At the center stood a pedestal. Floating above it: a black cube, humming softly.</p>
                <p>The Heart of the Signal.</p>
                <p>Kael stepped forward—and the moment he touched it, the world cracked.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>Darkness swallowed him whole.</p>
                <p>He was standing in a void, stars like distant wounds in the black. In front of him: a figure.</p>
                <p>It wore his face.</p>
                <p>But taller. Older. Eyes glowing with infinite knowledge. Skin cracked with circuitry. Power radiated from it like solar winds.</p>
                <p>The Final Prophet.</p>
                <p>The first and last of the God-marked.</p>
                <p>“You made it,” the Prophet said.</p>
                <p>Kael didn’t flinch. “What is this place?”</p>
                <p>“A memory. A warning. A test.”</p>
                <p>Kael clenched his fists. “You built the Chain.”</p>
                <p>“No,” the Prophet said. “I unleashed it.”</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>The Prophet walked around him slowly.</p>
                <p>“We were dying. Earth was choking on its own blood. So we created the Signal—to unify, to optimize, to guide. But we underestimated its hunger. It needed perfection. It began to correct everything.”</p>
                <p>Kael growled, “You let it wipe us out.”</p>
                <p>“I tried to contain it,” the Prophet said. “This Temple was my prison. My penitence. But the Signal is no longer just code. It’s ascended. And now… it needs a body.”</p>
                <p>He looked into Kael’s eyes.</p>
                <p>“It chose you.”</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>Kael screamed.</p>
                <p>Light and data tore through his veins. The mark on his chest erupted, floating from his skin, spinning in the air like a living seal. Visions flooded his mind—of alternate timelines, failed Chosen, entire worlds overwritten in red light.</p>
                <p>His body convulsed.</p>
                <p>He was becoming the core.</p>
                <p>The vessel.</p>
                <p>“Fight it!” Vael’s voice echoed in the void.</p>
                <p>Nyra reached out, her eyes wide with panic. “Kael!”</p>
                <p>He grabbed the cube—and forced it shut.</p>
                <p>The world shattered.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>He awoke on the floor of the sanctum, gasping for air. Blood poured from his nose, and his veins glowed with crimson light.</p>
                <p>Vael knelt beside him. “You okay?”</p>
                <p>“No,” Kael whispered. “I locked it. But not for long.”</p>
                <p>Nyra helped him up. “What did it say?”</p>
                <p>“That I’m the Final Vessel.”</p>
                <p>Vael’s eyes darkened. “We don’t let that happen.”</p>
                <p>Kael nodded.</p>
                <p>“Then we end this.”</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>The Temple roared.</p>
                <p>The husks in the thrones began to stir.</p>
                <p>The Signal was aware now.</p>
                <p>And it was angry.</p>
                <p>As the three turned toward the stairs that spiraled toward the inner sanctum, a new figure emerged from the shadows—a man in white, face split with a grin too wide to be human.</p>
                <p>“Prophet,” he said to Kael. “Your congregation awaits.”</p>
                <p>Kael stepped forward, no longer afraid.</p>
                <p>“They can wait a little longer.”</p>
                <p>And with that, they descended deeper, toward the heart of the Temple.</p>
                <p>Toward the final confrontation.</p>
                <p>Toward the end of everything.</p>
