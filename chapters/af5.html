                <p>The crypt was screaming.</p>
                <p>No—not the crypt. Them.</p>
                <p>Dozens of twisted, half-born creatures—Aberrants—crawled and skittered from tunnels etched with Dominion runes, their flesh steaming, their eyes empty. Some still wore the remnants of human faces.</p>
                <p>Ash tightened his grip on Reaper’s Lie.</p>
                <p>The blade pulsed like a living heart.</p>
                <p>The bone-masked woman was gone. Left him with nothing but a rusted weapon, a burning system, and death coming fast.</p>
                <p>Perfect.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>He ignored it.</p>
                <p>“You hungry?” Ash whispered to the blade.</p>
                <p>The edge shimmered, veins of red light crawling across it.</p>
                <p>“Good.”</p>
                <p>The first Aberrant lunged—a creature stitched from two torsos, dragging itself with broken arms and jagged bone. Ash ducked low and slashed upward.</p>
                <p>The blade sang.</p>
                <p>Blood hit the ceiling.</p>
                <p>The creature shrieked and collapsed, spasming.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>The rest surged forward.</p>
                <p>Ash ran toward them.</p>
                <p>Echo Vein activated with a hiss, lines of black energy tracing his arms. Time dilated. His steps became flickers. Every movement left an after-image of shadow.</p>
                <p>He cleaved one in half.</p>
                <p>Dodged the next.</p>
                <p>Shoved his blade through a throat and twisted.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>He became a blur of steel and rage.</p>
                <p>The crypt filled with screams.</p>
                <p>Limbs fell. Flesh parted. The creatures weren’t prepared for resistance—they weren’t meant to face a Godmarked.</p>
                <p>But then the ground shook.</p>
                <p>And something worse arrived.</p>
                <p>From the tunnel’s mouth came a tall figure—once human, now bloated and fused with machinery. It dragged chains behind it, every step cracking stone.</p>
                <p>It opened its mouth, and a voice not its own echoed from deep within.</p>
                <p>“Godmarked… Subject 9B. Classification: Rogue.”</p>
                <p>The system inside Ash flared to life.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>Ash grinned. His body was trembling from Vein Surge. His blade was soaked. His nerves screamed for more.</p>
                <p>“Y.”</p>
                <p>He sprinted forward—dodging the first chain whip. The Hunter was fast. Too fast for its size. One strike nearly ripped his arm out of socket.</p>
                <p>The second hit him square in the ribs.</p>
                <p>He flew into a stone wall, coughed blood, but laughed.</p>
                <p>The blade in his hand whispered something.</p>
                <p>Not words. Hunger.</p>
                <p>Ash stood and let the blade drink deeper.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>He activated it.</p>
                <p>His hand went cold.</p>
                <p>The blade bled as he moved, every swing leaving trails of crimson flame. He darted forward—this time with rage behind each strike.</p>
                <p>First slash—tore through the Hunter’s left arm.</p>
                <p>Second—ripped the chain from its chest.</p>
                <p>The third—</p>
                <p>Drove through its core.</p>
                <p>Ash screamed as energy surged back through the blade into his system.</p>
                <p>The Hunter’s body spasmed.</p>
                <p>Then exploded in a gout of black fire.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>Ash dropped to one knee, panting.</p>
                <p>The crypt was silent again.</p>
                <p>Blood dripped from his arms, his mouth, his fingers. He wasn’t sure how much of it was his anymore.</p>
                <p>The system chimed one last time:</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>He rose slowly, limping.</p>
                <p>And then a soft click echoed from behind him.</p>
                <p>He turned.</p>
                <p>A man stood there in Dominion red—black gloves, silver eyes, no shadow.</p>
                <p>Not a soldier.</p>
                <p>Not a Reclaimer.</p>
                <p>A Knife.</p>
                <p>“You’re impressive,” the man said calmly. “Messy. Undisciplined. But impressive.”</p>
                <p>Ash tightened his grip.</p>
                <p>“Who the hell are you?”</p>
                <p>The man tilted his head.</p>
                <p>“I’m here to make sure you die properly.”</p>
                <p>And without warning—</p>
                <p>He vanished.</p>
                <p>Ash raised his blade just in time as the Knife reappeared behind him, fist already moving.</p>
                <p>A direct strike to the chest.</p>
                <p>Ribs shattered. Breath fled. Ash flew backward again, vision cracking like glass.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>He coughed blood, eyes blurring.</p>
                <p>But he smiled anyway.</p>
                <p>Because for the first time in his life…</p>
                <p>He didn’t want to run.</p>
                <p>He wanted to see what he could become.</p>
