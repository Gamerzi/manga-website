                <p>Kael’s dreams were no longer his own.</p>
                <p>Each night, since absorbing the Chronite shard, he drifted into timelines he didn’t live—lives he might one day lead. Some were glorious. Others were monstrous.</p>
                <p>But one was always the same.</p>
                <p>A world drowned in Riftlight. Cities hovering above endless void. Oceans boiling. Stars falling like tears. And in the center stood a throne of shattered time—occupied by himself, wrapped in silver flame, eyes like collapsed stars.</p>
                <p>He always woke before that version turned to face him.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>Kael jolted awake, breath ragged, sweat soaking his skin. Asha was already up, scanning Rift flares across a shifting tactical map projected over their camp’s ground station.</p>
                <p>“You saw it again?” she asked quietly.</p>
                <p>Kael nodded. “The Axis throne.”</p>
                <p>Haron emerged from the shadows behind a crumbling pillar, rubbing sleep from his eyes. “The Rift’s bleeding into your sleep. The deeper you get in, the harder it is to tell dreams from warnings.”</p>
                <p>Kael sat up. “They’re more than dreams. I think I’m seeing echoes—real futures.”</p>
                <p>Asha’s gaze sharpened. “You’re evolving.”</p>
                <p>Kael looked at his hands. Silver lines—once veins—now glowed faintly under his skin. The Riftmark pulsed in a slow rhythm like a second heartbeat.</p>
                <p>“What happens when I fully become… whatever this is?”</p>
                <p>Haron didn’t answer.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p><em>Elsewhere — Nullspace Fortress</em></p>
                <p>The chamber was carved from frozen entropy itself. No material, no construct, no known reality should’ve supported its existence.</p>
                <p>At the center, the Axis Engine pulsed like a dying star.</p>
                <p>Nyra Voss stood before it, arms crossed. Behind her, Inquisitor engineers chanted fragments of the Chrono-Litany. Massive pylons charged with Riftlight formed a web of synthetic time-layers.</p>
                <p>“Status?” she asked.</p>
                <p>An Engineer bowed. “Temporal lattice stabilizing. Cross-timeline echoes locked. The Axis Protocol is primed.”</p>
                <p>“And the coordinates?”</p>
                <p>The Engineer hesitated. “Still oscillating, General. The engine is… searching. It seems to be choosing.”</p>
                <p>Nyra turned to the monolithic core—a crystal sphere caged in Nullsteel, spinning in every direction at once.</p>
                <p>“Let it choose,” she said. “It knows where Kael Draven is destined to fall.”</p>
                <p>She turned and walked away.</p>
                <p>Behind her, the Axis Engine flared—emitting a scream that wasn’t sound, but memory.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p><em>Back at the Outpost – The Drift-Shell Ruins</em></p>
                <p>The team had moved their base into a half-buried Architect outpost: a fractured dome of glass and obsidian humming with dormant tech. Kael stood inside a forgotten Archive Nexus, watching as timelines played out on a loop in the air—streams of possible futures flickering like projections on water.</p>
                <p>He saw:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A world where he led a rebellion against Null.</li>
                    <li>Another where he was Null.</li>
                    <li>One where he didn’t survive the Revenant.</li>
                    <li>And one where Asha killed him before he could lose control.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>He turned to Haron. “How do I stop this?”</p>
                <p>Haron sighed. “You don’t stop futures. You choose them.”</p>
                <p>Kael frowned. “That sounds like a lie wrapped in wisdom.”</p>
                <p>“Welcome to prophecy.”</p>
                <p>Before they could speak further, the dome shook. A warning flare lit the command table.</p>
                <p>Asha raced into the room. “Something’s coming. Bigger than anything we’ve seen. Multiple breaches—reality’s folding on itself.”</p>
                <p>Kael focused, feeling the Rift’s tension stretch across his spine like a violin string.</p>
                <p>He saw the Axis Engine.</p>
                <p>He felt it.</p>
                <p>Pulling.</p>
                <p>Searching.</p>
                <p>And then—locking.</p>
                <p>Kael’s vision went white.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p><em>Interlude — The Rift’s Mind</em></p>
                <p>For a fraction of a second, Kael was not in his body.</p>
                <p>He was everywhere.</p>
                <p>He was the falling stars. The screaming timelines. The broken past and the unborn futures. He stood before the Axis Engine, alone in the center of the cosmic spiral.</p>
                <p>A voice echoed—not sound, but idea.</p>
                <p><em>"You are not the key. You are the lock."</em></p>
                <p>He gasped.</p>
                <p>And returned.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p><em>The Riftquake Begins</em></p>
                <p>Reality ripped open above the ruins.</p>
                <p>The sky fractured. Three moons appeared at once—none of them real. The stars spun in reverse. Gravity failed for seconds at a time.</p>
                <p>The Axis Gate emerged—twisting metal and Riftflame, descending from the sky like a god’s blade stabbed into the earth.</p>
                <p>Kael, Asha, and Haron stood frozen.</p>
                <p>From the Gate stepped three figures in Void-Armor, faceless and silent, surrounded by orbiting glyphs.</p>
                <p>And then—her.</p>
                <p>Nyra Voss.</p>
                <p>Clad in ceremonial battle robes, her eyes burning silver, her voice amplified by layered resonance.</p>
                <p>“Kael Draven. You are the anomaly. The deviation. The fracture.”</p>
                <p>Kael’s fists clenched. “You woke the Revenant to kill me. Didn’t work.”</p>
                <p>Nyra smiled thinly. “That was phase one.”</p>
                <p>She stepped forward.</p>
                <p>“Phase two is conversion.”</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>Kael charged.</p>
                <p>Nyra lifted her hand. The world halted.</p>
                <p>Literally.</p>
                <p>Kael froze mid-strike. Asha’s lightning locked mid-flight. Haron’s words died on his lips.</p>
                <p>Only Nyra moved.</p>
                <p>She circled Kael.</p>
                <p>“You don’t understand your value,” she whispered. “You’re not meant to destroy the Rift. You’re meant to become its anchor. A living constant.”</p>
                <p>Kael fought against the stillness. His blood boiled.</p>
                <p>“The Axis Engine has chosen you, Kael. Your soul resonates with the core lattice. You could remake the multiverse.”</p>
                <p>“I don’t want to remake it,” he growled, teeth grinding.</p>
                <p>“I want to survive it.”</p>
                <p>Nyra paused.</p>
                <p>“You still think this is about survival.”</p>
                <p>She tapped Kael’s forehead.</p>
                <p>He screamed.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p><em>Vision Surge — Core of the Axis</em></p>
                <p>Kael stood again at the heart of the Axis.</p>
                <p>But now he saw deeper.</p>
                <p>Worlds built atop worlds—fractals of civilization, constantly rewritten. Null wasn’t preserving reality. It was rewriting it to match a single approved future.</p>
                <p>One controlled by the Axis.</p>
                <p>One built on him.</p>
                <p>He saw them—thousands of versions of himself—enslaved, erased, copied, broken.</p>
                <p>The Axis didn’t just want him.</p>
                <p>It was built from him.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>Kael broke the stillness with a primal roar.</p>
                <p>Time snapped.</p>
                <p>Asha and Haron rejoined motion in a wave of backlash energy.</p>
                <p>Kael’s Riftmark exploded outward, forming a burning sigil in the sky.</p>
                <p>The Axis Gate shuddered.</p>
                <p>Nyra staggered, blood at her lips. “You’re… rejecting the lattice?”</p>
                <p>Kael pointed at the Axis Gate.</p>
                <p>“Tell your Engine this—”</p>
                <p>He formed a blade of coalesced futures in his hand.</p>
                <p>“I’m not the key. I’m the demolition charge.”</p>
                <p>He threw the blade.</p>
                <p>It struck the Gate’s core.</p>
                <p>A chain reaction ignited.</p>
                <p>The Axis Gate imploded.</p>
                <p>The Riftquake collapsed.</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p>Silence.</p>
                <p>Nyra was gone. The Gate was gone.</p>
                <p>Kael dropped to one knee, exhausted, blood seeping from his eyes and ears.</p>
                <p>Asha ran to his side. “What did you do?”</p>
                <p>Kael blinked slowly.</p>
                <p>“I said no.”</p>
                <hr> <!-- Scene Break -->
                <p><em>Elsewhere — Null Apex Citadel</em></p>
                <p>The Axis Engine screamed.</p>
                <p>Every timeline shifted by one node.</p>
                <p>In the control chamber, a Null Seer fell to her knees. “He severed the anchor. The future is—unwritten.”</p>
                <p>General Nyra, coughing blood but alive, stared into a Rift mirror.</p>
                <p>And saw Kael Draven looking back.</p>
                <p>“You made your move, Kael,” she whispered.</p>
                <p>“I’ll make mine.”</p>
