                <p>Kael floated within the Forge Nexus, his body suspended between realms. The Endlight surrounded him—a luminous storm of potentiality—each bolt a world, each flash a different him.</p>
                <p>He wasn’t alone.</p>
                <p>Behind the veil of light stood the Third Blade.</p>
                <p>It wasn’t metal or magic. It was made of absence. Where Nullfang shone with truth and Duskbane bled despair, this weapon consumed. A void where thought, time, and soul unraveled.</p>
                <p>Kael’s hand twitched.</p>
                <p>“Don’t,” said Varis from the edge of the chamber. “It’s not meant to be touched. Not yet.”</p>
                <p>He turned to her, voice tight. “What is it?”</p>
                <p>“The blade forged from the Forgotten. The ghosts of timelines that were never born. It doesn’t kill—it erases. Entire histories vanish when it strikes.”</p>
                <p>“Then why is it here?”</p>
                <p>“Because you put it here.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Past That Wasn't</em></p>
                <p>The Nexus trembled.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, Kael’s mind was flooded with fractured memories—half-familiar faces, places that felt like dreams wrapped in fog.</p>
                <p>He saw a woman with obsidian wings—a lover? A sister?
                A boy with glowing eyes screaming as flames devoured him.
                A tower made of gears, ticking backward.
                A war that never happened... but should have.</p>
                <p>“What is this?” he groaned, clutching his head.</p>
                <p>Varis answered grimly. “Residual memories. Every version of you that tried to end the war made sacrifices. Some rewound time. Others collapsed it. One even fractured himself into eight shards... which became the Council.”</p>
                <p>Kael turned, stunned. “You mean—they’re all me?”</p>
                <p>“Fragments. Mutated by grief and power. You’re the last unbroken one.”</p>
                <p>Kael laughed bitterly. “Then why do I feel so shattered?”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Return of the Hunter</em></p>
                <p>A crack tore through the Nexus.</p>
                <p>From its edge stepped the Hunter.</p> <!-- Assuming 'the Hunter' refers to the previous antagonist, but the text doesn't explicitly confirm. Adjust if needed. -->
                <p>Still wearing the cloak of burning feathers. His blade—Lament—no longer glowed red, but pulsed with something worse: silence.</p>
                <p>“You left me in that tower,” the Hunter said.</p>
                <p>Kael’s throat went dry. “You were dying.”</p>
                <p>“I was reborn. In pain. In truth.”</p>
                <p>Varis stepped forward, staff raised. “You don’t belong here, Hunter.”</p>
                <p>“I belong everywhere he does.” His eyes locked on Kael. “We share the same origin. The same burden. But where he hesitates, I act.”</p>
                <p>Kael drew Nullfang.</p>
                <p>“I won’t let you take the Forge.”</p>
                <p>The Hunter smiled.</p>
                <p>“I don’t want the Forge.”</p>
                <p>He pointed to the third blade.</p>
                <p>“I want that.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Battle Beneath Infinity</em></p>
                <p>The Nexus dimmed as power surged.</p>
                <p>Kael lunged, Nullfang clashing with Lament. Sparks spiraled into orbits, forming moons around their blades. The Hunter’s strength had grown—each strike pushed Kael back through layers of time.</p>
                <p>He fell through one where the sky burned silver.</p>
                <p>Another where the ground was made of bone.</p>
                <p>Another still—where a younger him wept over the corpse of a woman in priestess robes.</p>
                <p>That one hurt most.</p>
                <p>Kael screamed, unleashing a pulse of truthfire from Nullfang. It exploded outward, slicing the Nexus into fragments—but the Hunter dodged with impossible grace, his movements a blur of cause and effect reversed.</p>
                <p>“You can’t win!” the Hunter shouted. “The Void Blade calls to me!”</p>
                <p>“And I refuse to let it answer!”</p>
                <p>They clashed again—steel biting steel, flame devouring shadow.</p>
                <p>Then—</p>
                <p>Kael dropped his sword.</p>
                <p>Not by mistake.</p>
                <p>By choice.</p>
                <p>The Hunter blinked. “What?”</p>
                <p>Kael stepped forward, empty hands raised. “You want the blade? Then take it.”</p>
                <p>The Hunter hesitated.</p>
                <p>Touched the hilt of the third blade.</p>
                <p>And screamed.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Echo's Curse</em></p>
                <p>Darkness poured from the void blade into him. Not power—absence. His body convulsed. His form flickered.</p>
                <p>He was being unmade.</p>
                <p>“No—no—this isn’t what I saw—!” the Hunter shrieked.</p>
                <p>Kael reached out. “Let it go! You were never meant to wield it!”</p>
                <p>But it was too late.</p>
                <p>The Hunter vanished—ripped from every timeline.</p>
                <p>His name, his memory, even his echoes—gone.</p>
                <p>The Nexus fell silent.</p>
                <p>Kael collapsed to one knee.</p>
                <p>Varis helped him up.</p>
                <p>“You gambled everything.”</p>
                <p>“I knew he couldn’t resist it. And I knew it would destroy him.”</p>
                <p>“You didn’t kill him,” she said. “You deleted him.”</p>
                <p>Kael stared at the empty place where the Hunter had stood.</p>
                <p>And whispered, “That’s worse.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Fragments Reunited</em></p>
                <p>The Council reappeared. The seven thrones glowed with renewed light.</p>
                <p>“You have done what none of us could,” said the frost-armored one.</p>
                <p>“You’ve chosen not to rule, but to redeem,” added the shadowed one.</p>
                <p>One by one, the fragments of Kael rose from their thrones.</p>
                <p>And stepped into him.</p>
                <p>He didn’t fight it.</p>
                <p>They became whole.</p>
                <p>Kael screamed as the weight of a thousand lives entered him. Pain tore through him—grief, rage, joy, love, fear, hatred—all the versions of himself he’d ever been.</p>
                <p>When it ended...</p>
                <p>He stood alone.</p>
                <p>But not broken.</p>
                <p>Varis knelt. “My lord.”</p>
                <p>Kael shook his head. “No more lords. No more blades.”</p>
                <p>He walked to the third sword—still pulsing with dark potential.</p>
                <p>And cast it into the Void.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Afterlight</em></p>
                <p>The Nexus began to collapse. Its purpose fulfilled.</p>
                <p>Varis smiled faintly. “You’ve reset the balance.”</p>
                <p>Kael turned to her. “What now?”</p>
                <p>“You return. To the beginning. To a world you can shape. You’ll forget most of this. The pain. The power. But something will remain. A flicker. A whisper.”</p>
                <p>Kael nodded slowly.</p>
                <p>And stepped into the light.</p>
