                <p>The world trembled.</p>
                <p>Above the Sacred Bloom Grove, the sky turned a strange color — half night, half burning gold — as Arjun faced Lord Raven.</p> <!-- Assuming Lord Raven is the primary antagonist here -->
                <p>The masked assassin floated a few meters above the ground, dark robes billowing, surrounded by black mist.</p>
                <p>Arjun, wings flared wide, radiated pure golden light, feathers humming with raw energy.</p>
                <p>One was the terror of the underworld. The other was the rising monarch of the skies.</p>
                <p>Both knew — Only one would leave this place alive.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The First Strike</em></p>
                <p>Lord Raven moved first.</p>
                <p>With a flick of his hand, dozens of shadow blades materialized midair, sharp enough to split spirit stones.</p>
                <p>They shot toward Arjun like a rain of death.</p>
                <p>Arjun beat his wings once.</p>
                <p>A blast of golden wind tore through the blades, shattering them into harmless sparks.</p>
                <p>Before the pieces even fell, Arjun charged.</p>
                <p>He flew low, fast, claws extended.</p>
                <p>Lord Raven smirked and raised his hand again — black chains surged from the earth, trying to bind Arjun's wings.</p>
                <p>But Arjun twisted mid-flight, a maneuver impossible for a normal eagle, and slashed the chains apart with a strike of pure wind energy.</p>
                <p>He closed the distance in a heartbeat.</p>
                <p>Talons clashed against a shield of darkness.</p>
                <p>A shockwave erupted.</p>
                <p>The trees nearby exploded into splinters. The spirit flowers were ripped from the ground, petals scattering like a storm.</p>
                <p>The force of the impact hurled both fighters backward.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Awakening</em></p>
                <p>The girl — still lying on the glowing lotus — gasped.</p>
                <p>Her eyelashes fluttered.</p>
                <p>The jade pendant around her neck blazed even brighter, responding to Arjun's fierce will.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Who...?"</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Where am I...?"</p></blockquote>
                <p>Her vision was blurry, but she could see a golden figure battling a monster in black.</p>
                <p>A familiar warmth touched her heart.</p>
                <p>Tears welled up, though she didn’t know why.</p>
                <p>Somehow, deep down, she knew —</p>
                <blockquote><p>That eagle was protecting her.</p></blockquote>
                <hr>
                <p>Meanwhile, Arjun felt something inside him snap.</p>
                <p>A second flood of power poured through his blood, richer and more ancient than anything he had ever touched before.</p>
                <p>His body burned — feathers melting into flesh in places — bone reshaping itself.</p>
                <p>Pain.</p>
                <p>Agony.</p>
                <p>But he embraced it.</p>
                <p>From his massive eagle form, Arjun's body shrank slightly, becoming more compact, more powerful.</p>
                <p>Golden armor-like scales appeared over his chest. His talons shifted, becoming golden boots wrapped in radiant energy. His wings became smaller but sharper, glowing blades behind him.</p>
                <p>And for the first time —</p>
                <p>Arjun stood on two legs.</p>
                <p>A partial human form.</p>
                <p>Still more beast than man — but unmistakably evolving.</p>
                <p>Lord Raven stumbled back, genuinely shocked.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Impossible!"</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"A mere beast... achieving a Divine Transformation?!"</p></blockquote>
                <p>Arjun's new eyes — deep golden, burning with a royal light — stared him down.</p>
                <p>He opened his mouth —</p>
                <p>And spoke.</p>
                <p>A single word, rough and broken but clear:</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Die."</p></blockquote>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The True Battle</em></p>
                <p>Arjun attacked.</p>
                <p>No longer just slashing with talons — He moved like a warrior.</p>
                <p>His fists, coated in golden energy, struck with thunderous force. His wings slashed the air, sending invisible blades outward that cut trees and rocks alike.</p>
                <p>Lord Raven retaliated, summoning massive black golems to fight for him.</p>
                <p>Arjun tore through them like paper.</p>
                <p>Each punch shattered stone. Each kick split the earth.</p>
                <p>Boom. Boom. Boom.</p>
                <p>The battlefield became a ruin of craters, broken trees, and rivers of blood.</p>
                <p>The assassins who had stayed to watch fled in terror, realizing this fight was beyond them.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Lord Raven grew desperate.</p>
                <p>He shed his robe, revealing a monstrous body stitched together from hundreds of beast parts — claws, fangs, scaled skin — all stolen through dark arts.</p>
                <p>He had sacrificed his humanity long ago for power.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You are a mistake!" Lord Raven howled, charging.</p></blockquote>
                <p>Arjun said nothing…</p>
