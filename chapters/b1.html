            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The setting sun bathed the world in a blood-red glow, as if mourning a death yet to happen. At the center of the ruined Spirit Temple, a lone figure knelt — broken, bruised, and forgotten.</p>
                <p>Arjun.</p>
                <p>He was once the pride of the Azure Cloud Sect — the youngest Inner Disciple in history, a prodigy whose name shook the four regions. Elders praised him. Seniors envied him. Even the Sect Master had personally instructed him.</p>
                <p>Yet now, he was nothing more than discarded trash.</p>
                <p>His robes, once clean and embroidered with sect symbols, were torn and stained with blood. His breathing was shallow; his spirit core shattered into countless fragments.</p>
                <p>The voices of betrayal still echoed in his mind.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"He's too talented! If we don't cripple him now, he'll surpass us all!"</p>
                    <p>"Break his core! Destroy his meridians!"</p>
                    <p>"Trash doesn't belong in Azure Cloud!"</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The senior disciples, those he once called brothers, had ganged up on him. Even the Elders turned a blind eye — their jealousy blinding their honor.</p>
                <p>Arjun clutched his chest, feeling the cold seep into his bones.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Why?</p>
                    <p>Why did it end like this?</p>
                    <p>What did I do wrong?</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Tears mixed with the dirt on his face, but his eyes burned with silent rage.</p>
                <p>The Spirit Temple around him was a cursed place — abandoned after an ancient beast had slaughtered an entire generation of cultivators. No one dared come here. They thought leaving him here was a death sentence.</p>
                <p>And perhaps... they were right.</p>
                <p>His vision blurred. The world spun. His consciousness flickered like a dying candle.</p>
                <p>But just as despair was about to swallow him whole — the ground beneath him trembled.</p>
                <p>Crack!</p>
                <p>A thin line of golden light seeped from a crack in the floor, wrapping around Arjun's shattered body.</p>
                <p>He didn't have the strength to move. All he could do was watch as the golden light entered his wounds, flooding his meridians, his spirit core, and even his very soul.</p>
                <p>Pain erupted. Not the kind of pain that tore flesh — no, this was deeper, sharper. It shredded his spirit, melted his bones, and rebuilt him from the inside out.</p>
                <p>In his mind, a voice echoed — ancient, majestic, like the roar of a divine beast.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>[Awakening Initiated.]</p>
                    <p>[Host recognized: Arjun.]</p>
                    <p>[Activating dormant bloodline: Golden Sky Eagle.]</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Bloodlines were rare even among Spirit Beasts. Among humans, they were mythical.</p>
                <p>And now — a broken boy had awakened a bloodline feared by gods and revered by ancestors.</p>
                <p>Arjun screamed — but no sound came out. Feathers of radiant gold burst from his skin. His arms reshaped into mighty wings. His vision sharpened beyond mortal limits.</p>
                <p>A storm of golden energy exploded outward, shaking the ruins.</p>
                <p>Where once a broken boy lay — now stood (no, soared) a creature of legend.</p>
                <p>A Golden Sky Eagle, its feathers glowing with an ethereal light, its talons sharp enough to rend mountains, and its eyes burning with unyielding will.</p>
                <p>Arjun flapped his wings, lifting into the twilight sky.</p>
                <p>No chains could bind him now. No betrayal could stop his ascent.</p>
                <p>He was no longer just a human. He was a force of nature — destined to carve his own legend into the heavens.</p>
                <p>As the winds howled around him, Arjun made a silent vow:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I will return.</p>
                    <p>Stronger than ever.</p>
                    <p>And those who betrayed me... shall kneel before me.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The first flight of the Golden Sky Eagle lit up the darkening skies — a sign that a new era was about to begin.</p>
                <p>An era forged by the wings of vengeance, destiny, and rebirth.</p>
