                <p>The golden sunrise poured over the ruins of the Sacred Bloom Grove.</p>
                <p>Arjun lay beside the girl, his breath heavy, body aching. His half-human form flickered between eagle and man, unstable.</p>
                <p>But he didn’t care.</p>
                <p>The girl was safe. The danger was over — for now.</p>
                <p>Slowly, she sat up, her delicate fingers clutching the jade pendant at her throat. Her wide, clear eyes gazed at Arjun, full of wonder and something deeper.</p>
                <p>Gratitude.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Thank you..." she whispered.</p></blockquote>
                <p>Her voice was like the first note of a spring song — soft, trembling, beautiful.</p>
                <p>Arjun, still half-beast, struggled to form words.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You... okay?" he managed.</p></blockquote>
                <p>The girl nodded.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"My name is Mei Ling."</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"And you... who are you?"</p></blockquote>
                <p>Arjun paused.</p>
                <p>In this new form, memories flickered inside him — flashes of another life, another name.</p>
                <p>But the name that surfaced was the one carved into his soul now:</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Arjun."</p></blockquote>
                <p>The girl smiled.</p>
                <p>The old healer, finally recovered, limped toward them.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Arjun... Mei Ling... Fate has truly woven your paths together."</p></blockquote>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Secret of Mei Ling</em></p>
                <p>As the healer tended to Arjun’s battered body, Mei Ling stared at her own hands.</p>
                <p>They glowed faintly — tiny wisps of golden and green light spiraling around her fingers.</p>
                <p>Fear and awe filled her heart.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"I feel... different," she said, voice trembling. "What happened to me?"</p></blockquote>
                <p>The old healer looked grave.</p>
                <p>He pointed at the jade pendant she wore.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"This... is the Heart of Verdant Spring — one of the nine Divine Relics of the ancient world."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Mei Ling gasped.</p>
                <p>Even Arjun’s unstable heart beat faster.</p>
                <p>Divine Relics were legends — objects said to hold the power to create life... or destroy it.</p>
                <p>The healer continued:</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You were not just an ordinary girl. You are the chosen vessel of the Heart."</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"It has healed your body... but it has also awakened your bloodline."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Mei Ling clutched the pendant tighter.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Bloodline...? What does that mean?"</p></blockquote>
                <p>The healer’s voice grew low, heavy:</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You are the last descendant of the Verdant Sovereign Clan — rulers of life and spirit energy."</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"And now... every enemy of the ancient world will come for you."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Silence.</p>
                <p>The weight of destiny crashed onto Mei Ling’s small shoulders.</p>
                <p>Tears welled in her eyes, but she bit her lip and nodded.</p>
                <p>Arjun watched her.</p>
                <p>Admired her.</p>
                <p>She was fragile, yet unyielding — like a flower growing through stone.</p>
                <p>And for reasons he didn’t fully understand, he made a silent vow.</p>
                <blockquote><p>He would protect her.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>No matter who came.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>No matter what price he had to pay.</p></blockquote>
                <hr>
                <p><em>New Threats Emerge</em></p>
                <p>Far beyond the forest, across mountains and ruined cities...</p>
                <p>A figure sat atop a black dragon, overlooking the world.</p>
                <p>His armor was made of beast bones. His eyes burned with crimson fire.</p>
                <p>He crushed a communication crystal in his fist.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"The Heart of Verdant Spring... has awakened?"</p></blockquote>
                <p>Behind him, an army of spirit beasts roared.</p>
                <p>Another figure, cloaked in blue robes, knelt behind him.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Lord Zorath, should we move?"</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Move?" Zorath grinned, a savage, bloodthirsty smile.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"We march.<br>We hunt.<br>We kill."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Thousands of spirit beasts howled into the sky, shaking the heavens.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>At the same time, deep in the hidden sects of the human cultivators, bells tolled.</p>
                <p>In the Holy Lotus Sect, golden-armored warriors gathered.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"The vessel must be captured."</p></blockquote>
                <p>In the Iron Blood Palace, cruel elders sharpened their weapons.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"The Heart must be stolen — at any cost."</p></blockquote>
                <p>All forces — human and beast alike — now raced toward one place:</p>
                <p>Sacred Bloom Grove.</p>
                <p>Toward Arjun. Toward Mei Ling.</p>
                <p>The storm was coming.</p>
                <p>And Arjun, barely stabilizing his new form, would have to stand against it.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Bond</em></p>
                <p>That night, under the stars, Arjun sat near the campfire.</p>
                <p>Mei Ling sat across from him, humming a soft melody. Her presence soothed the chaos…</p>
