                <p>The hills beyond Black Hollow were wastelands — dead, silent, endless.</p>
                <p>Kaelen moved through them like a fading shadow, his cloak whipping in the cold wind.</p>
                <p>Every step away from the city felt like shedding another chain, another lie.</p>
                <p>But freedom came at a cost.</p>
                <p>His wounds festered.</p>
                <p>The stolen energy inside him flickered, unstable, gnawing at his spirit like a starving wolf.</p>
                <p>He needed help.</p>
                <p>Knowledge.</p>
                <p>Control.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, he would die before he ever had the chance to fight back.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>By the second night, the fever hit him.</p>
                <p>It came like a wave — first a shiver, then a burning heat that left him gasping on the barren ground.</p>
                <p>Visions tore through his mind: flames devouring the sky, cities crumbling into black dust, a silver eye watching from beyond the stars.</p>
                <p>He heard whispers in a language he didn’t know — words that seared themselves into his bones.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Child of Ruin..."</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Bearer of the Last Light..."</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Awaken, and be consumed."</p></blockquote>
                <p>He tried to scream, but no sound came out.</p>
                <p>The fever crushed him under its weight.</p>
                <p>And then —</p>
                <p>— a hand touched his forehead.</p>
                <p>Cold, calloused.</p>
                <p>Real.</p>
                <p>The visions shattered like glass.</p>
                <p>Kaelen blinked through the haze and saw a face looming over him.</p>
                <p>A woman — wrapped in a cloak of pale gray feathers, her skin like moonlight, her eyes...</p>
                <p>Her eyes were not human.</p>
                <p>They were deep pools of shifting stars, vast and ancient and filled with sorrow.</p>
                <p>She murmured a word — a single syllable that burned through Kaelen's mind like fire through dry leaves.</p>
                <p>The fever broke instantly.</p>
                <p>Kaelen gasped, the world snapping back into painful focus.</p>
                <p>The woman sat back on her heels, regarding him with a mixture of curiosity and sadness.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You are dying," she said, her voice low and musical.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"But not from the wounds you carry."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen struggled to sit up.</p>
                <p>Pain flared, but he managed it.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Who... who are you?" he rasped.</p></blockquote>
                <p>The woman tilted her head slightly.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Once, I was called many things. Priestess. Outcast. Traitor."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She smiled, a brief flicker of something almost kind.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"But now... I am simply Selene."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen stared at her, heart hammering.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You saved me."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Selene shook her head.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"No. I delayed your death."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She reached into her cloak and withdrew a vial filled with shimmering liquid.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Drink. Or the power inside you will eat you from within."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen hesitated.</p>
                <p>He had trusted too easily once.</p>
                <p>It had cost him everything.</p>
                <p>But something in Selene’s gaze — the weary weight of it — told him she was no enemy.</p>
                <p>Slowly, he took the vial and drank.</p>
                <p>It tasted like winter storms and blood and light.</p>
                <p>Immediately, the burning inside him receded, settling into a steady thrum.</p>
                <p>Kaelen sagged in relief.</p>
                <p>Selene watched him closely.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You bear the mark of the Forgotten," she said softly.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"The last spark of a god long dead."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen frowned.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"I don't understand."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Selene’s eyes darkened.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You will. Whether you wish to or not."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She rose gracefully, the feathers of her cloak whispering against each other.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Come. There is little time."</p></blockquote>
                <hr>
                <p>They traveled through the dead hills for hours — Kaelen stumbling, Selene moving like mist.</p>
                <p>She spoke little.</p>
                <p>When Kaelen pressed her, she only said:</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Questions must wait for sanctuary. The world listens."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Finally, they reached a narrow canyon, hidden from the open sky.</p>
                <p>At its heart stood a crumbling shrine — ancient, half-buried in sand and ash.</p>
                <p>Strange runes covered its broken stones.</p>
                <p>Selene knelt before it, tracing the symbols with reverent fingers.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"This was once a place of power," she said.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Long before men forgot the old ways."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen looked around warily.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"I don't see anything powerful now."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Selene smiled sadly.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Power rarely shouts. It whispers."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She turned to him, her eyes gleaming.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"And you must learn to listen."</p></blockquote>
                <hr>
                <p>The ritual was simple — and brutal.</p>
                <p>Selene drew a circle in the ash with a blade of bone.</p>
                <p>She placed Kaelen in the center, binding his hands with silver cord.</p>
                <p>Then she began to chant — low and rhythmic, a sound that stirred something deep and ancient in Kaelen’s blood.</p>
                <p>The runes around them glowed faintly, pulsing with each beat of her voice.</p>
                <p>Kaelen felt the ember inside him awaken — not with violence this time, but with yearning.</p>
                <p>It reached out toward the shrine, toward the ancient power lingering like a ghost.</p>
                <p>Pain lanced through him — but he gritted his teeth, enduring.</p>
                <p>The whispers returned, louder now.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Choose..."</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Become..."</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Burn, or rise."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen clenched his fists.</p>
                <p>He thought of Black Hollow.</p>
                <p>Of the hunters.</p>
                <p>Of the brand on his skin.</p>
                <p>Of the chains he had broken, and the chains yet to be shattered.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"I choose to rise," he whispered.</p></blockquote>
                <p>The ember roared in response.</p>
                <p>A torrent of light exploded from Kaelen's chest, engulfing the shrine, the canyon, the very sky.</p>
                <p>When the light faded, Kaelen collapsed to his knees, gasping.</p>
                <p>Selene stood over him, her expression unreadable.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You have taken the first step," she said quietly.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"But the path ahead is long. And the world will not forgive you for walking it."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen looked up at her, eyes burning with new fire.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"I don't want forgiveness."</p></blockquote>
                <p>He rose unsteadily to his feet.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"I want justice."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Selene smiled — not kindly, but with grim satisfaction.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Then come, child of ruin."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She turned and began walking deeper into the canyon.</p>
                <p>Kaelen followed, his heart pounding.</p>
                <p>The gods might be dead.</p>
                <p>The world might be broken.</p>
                <p>But he was still breathing.</p>
                <p>And he would not be forgotten.</p>
