                <p>When Kael touched the stasis chamber, reality folded.</p>
                <p>Not bent. Not warped.</p>
                <p>Folded.</p>
                <p>Like a page in a book turning in reverse—except the ink ran backward, the paper bled, and the story whispered as it rewrote itself.</p>
                <p>His feet lost the ground. His breath froze in his chest. Time became syrup—slow, thick, impossible to navigate.</p>
                <p>And then—nothing.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Awakening</em></p>
                <p>Kael gasped as if surfacing from drowning. But the air he inhaled wasn’t real—it burned cold and sweet, like frost laced with fire.</p>
                <p>He opened his eyes.</p>
                <p>The world had changed.</p>
                <p>The desert, the tower, Lira, Jorin—gone.</p>
                <p>He stood in a city made entirely of light and crystal. Skyscrapers reached into black clouds that sparked with violet lightning. Floating platforms carried cloaked figures across impossible bridges. In the sky, a second sun spun in reverse, its light casting elongated shadows that moved independently of their owners.</p>
                <p>This was not his world.</p>
                <p>It was not any world he’d known.</p>
                <p>And yet... it felt familiar.</p>
                <p>Kael looked down.</p>
                <p>He was wearing the obsidian robes from the mirror.</p>
                <p>On his back—the sword.</p>
                <p>He gripped its hilt instinctively. It pulsed—alive, warm, sentient. It whispered a name into his mind: Nullfang.</p>
                <p>Before he could process more, a voice echoed behind him.</p>
                <p>“You’re early, Variant.”</p>
                <p>Kael turned.</p>
                <p>A tall woman in bone-white armor approached. Her eyes were mechanical, rotating like gyroscopic lenses. One hand held a staff made of memory threads—shimmering like water trapped in time.</p>
                <p>“Who are you?” Kael asked.</p>
                <p>“Executor Varis. And you're not supposed to be here yet.”</p>
                <p>Kael frowned. “Where is here?”</p>
                <p>She studied him.</p>
                <p>Then sighed. “The Axis Crucible. One of the last convergent zones between timelines. This is where broken variants are contained.”</p>
                <p>“I’m not broken.”</p>
                <p>“Every version of you is. That’s why you exist.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Truth of the Eights</em></p>
                <p>Varis led Kael to a spiraling tower of translucent stone. Along the walls, glyphs hovered—moments from other timelines frozen in loops.</p>
                <p>In one, Kael watched himself slay a kingdom with a single breath of fire.</p>
                <p>In another, he became the Harbinger, fused to the Riftgate like a god of annihilation.</p>
                <p>And in yet another, he saw himself weeping beside a child’s grave—hands soaked in blood not his own.</p>
                <p>“You’ve lived hundreds of versions,” Varis said. “You’re what we call an Axis-Tether. One of eight across the multiverse. You anchor potential... and catastrophe.”</p>
                <p>Kael stared, fists clenched.</p>
                <p>“I’m not a puppet.”</p>
                <p>“No. You’re a catalyst.”</p>
                <p>She pointed to a massive door—circular, etched with ancient runes.</p>
                <p>“Behind this lies the Forge. A place where the eight shall decide the fate of all timelines.”</p>
                <p>“And if I refuse?”</p>
                <p>“You already didn’t.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Council of Shadows</em></p>
                <p>The door opened.</p>
                <p>Inside—a round chamber, floating in space. No walls. Just stars.</p>
                <p>Seven figures sat in hovering thrones, each dressed in unique armors of time, flame, shadow, and steel.</p>
                <p>The Eight Points of Shadow.</p>
                <p>One spoke—a massive figure of charred bark and lava.</p>
                <p>“This is the Last Kael.”</p>
                <p>Another, draped in living shadows, hissed, “He’s still bound to Nullfang. Dangerous.”</p>
                <p>A third, wearing a crown of dying suns, leaned forward. “But he’s awake. That’s what matters.”</p>
                <p>Kael stepped forward.</p>
                <p>“Why me? Why any of us?”</p>
                <p>The one in frost-blue armor replied. “Because we were the ones who broke the veil. Each of us killed a god. And in doing so, we tore the multiverse open.”</p>
                <p>Kael swallowed. “Then fix it.”</p>
                <p>“That’s why you’re here,” said the crowned one. “The Veilbreaker Protocol requires all eight to ignite the Endlight Forge. A singular spark to choose a final reality.”</p>
                <p>Kael shook his head.</p>
                <p>“No. This isn’t balance. This is erasure.”</p>
                <p>Silence.</p>
                <p>Until the shadowed one whispered:</p>
                <p>“Then we have no choice.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Betrayal and Fire</em></p>
                <p>Kael felt it before it happened—the shift in the chamber. The shadows curling. The sudden drop in gravity.</p>
                <p>One of the eight rose—the Kael from the stasis pod. His twin. His alternate. The one who had never left the void.</p>
                <p>“Too soft,” the twin muttered, stepping forward. “This one still hopes.”</p>
                <p>Kael drew Nullfang. The blade burned blue now—truthlight.</p>
                <p>His twin’s weapon gleamed black—Duskbane.</p>
                <p>The two blades clashed in a storm of light and shadow, cracking the very chamber. Sparks flew into the void, becoming stars.</p>
                <p>“You don’t understand!” the twin shouted. “This is the only way we survive!”</p>
                <p>“No,” Kael growled, spinning low, slashing. “This is how we lose ourselves!”</p>
                <p>The others watched.</p>
                <p>Testing them.</p>
                <p>Judging.</p>
                <p>In the end, Kael struck true—cutting through Duskbane, breaking his twin’s blade.</p>
                <p>But he didn’t kill him.</p>
                <p>He dropped Nullfang and stepped back.</p>
                <p>“We are not enemies. We’re echoes. I refuse to kill myself for your broken dreams.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Fracture</em></p>
                <p>The council murmured.</p>
                <p>One by one, they stood.</p>
                <p>And bowed.</p>
                <p>“You’ve chosen mercy in the place of ruin,” the crown-bearer said. “The Endlight has chosen.”</p>
                <p>A pillar of pure energy rose between them.</p>
                <p>Kael reached for it—and for a moment, all timelines were visible. A thousand versions of Tareth Kai. A million choices.</p>
                <p>And at the center, the sword.</p>
                <p>Nullfang.</p>
                <p>And something beyond it.</p>
                <p>A scream from the darkness.</p>
                <p>A third blade.</p>
                <p>Waking.</p>
                <p><strong>End of Chapter 28</strong></p>
