                <p><em>One Year Later</em></p>
                <p>The village of Taran's Reach was simple. Wooden fences. Stone wells. Fields that bowed to the wind.</p>
                <p>And in a cottage at its edge, a man named Kael lived quietly. He farmed. He taught the village children to read. He fixed roofs. He slept soundly.</p>
                <p>But some nights, when the moon hung too low and the stars trembled, he would dream of swords made of light and shadow, timelines unraveling, and a name whispered from nowhere.</p>
                <p>Voidwrought.</p>
                <p>He never remembered those dreams when he awoke.</p>
                <p>Only that something vast and terrible was watching. Waiting.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Sky Cracks Open</em></p>
                <p>It began with a tremor. A sharp crack that split the sky above Taran’s Reach. Villagers pointed in fear as violet lightning tore through the clouds.</p>
                <p>Kael dropped his tools. His eyes widened—not in fear, but recognition.</p>
                <p>He ran to the village square just as the rift opened.</p>
                <p>And through it stepped the Last One.</p>
                <p>She wore no armor. Her body was glass, glowing with fractured timelines. Around her head swirled the remnants of unmade realities—voices that screamed without language.</p>
                <p>Kael felt her name in his bones: The Archive.</p>
                <p>“You shouldn’t be here,” he said.</p>
                <p>“I was erased,” she replied. “But the blade remembers me.”</p>
                <p>Behind her, floating like a wound in the air, was the Void Blade. He’d cast it into nothingness.</p>
                <p>But nothing, it seemed, could hold it forever.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Forgotten Return</em></p>
                <p>The Archive pointed a finger at Kael.</p>
                <p>“You hold fragments of the truth. The Council merged with you. The Hunter’s echo was absorbed. You are a prison wearing skin.”</p>
                <p>Kael clenched his fists. “I’m just a man.”</p>
                <p>“No. You are the seal.”</p>
                <p>With a thought, she shattered the world around them.</p>
                <p>The village warped. People froze mid-motion. Trees burned backward. Time unraveled like thread.</p>
                <p>Kael screamed as his hidden power awoke. All the timelines within him—all the fractured selves—began to bleed through.</p>
                <p>The Kael who was a warlord.</p>
                <p>The Kael who was a priest.</p>
                <p>The Kael who had killed the gods.</p>
                <p>They all screamed in unison, fighting for dominance.</p>
                <p>Varis’ voice whispered in his mind:</p>
                <p><em>Remember who you are. Not what you were.</em></p>
                <p>Kael fell to his knees.</p>
                <p>And then stood.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Blade Reforged</em></p>
                <p>He extended his hand.</p>
                <p>Nullfang. Duskbane. Even the Third Blade—they did not return.</p>
                <p>Instead, a new sword formed in his grasp.</p>
                <p>Not made of metal.</p>
                <p>Made of memories.</p>
                <p>The Idle Blade.</p>
                <p>It pulsed with light and stillness, forged from every quiet moment he had earned. Every act of mercy. Every choice not to kill.</p>
                <p>It was not a weapon.</p>
                <p>It was a promise.</p>
                <p>He faced the Archive.</p>
                <p>“I am not your jailor. I am the guardian of what was.”</p>
                <p>“And I am what should have been,” she hissed.</p>
                <p>She charged, tearing through time like a hurricane.</p>
                <p>Kael moved calmly.</p>
                <p>And they clashed.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Final Battle</em></p>
                <p>The sky was unmade.</p>
                <p>Kael and the Archive fought across realities.</p>
                <p>One moment, they were in a future where machines ruled the stars.<br>
                Next, they battled in a past where dragons circled shattered moons.<br>
                Then, a world of silence, where only thought existed—and even thought bled.</p>
                <p>Each strike from her chipped away at his being. She wielded loss like a scythe.</p>
                <p>But Kael—Kael endured.</p>
                <p>With each blow, he remembered:</p>
                <p>—His mother’s song<br>
                —The scent of the fields after rain<br>
                —The warmth of a stranger’s fire<br>
                —The laughter of children</p>
                <p>These were his power.</p>
                <p>And in the last moment, as she raised the Void Blade—</p>
                <p>Kael whispered, “I forgive you.”</p>
                <p>The Archive faltered.</p>
                <p>Her blade struck—</p>
                <p>—and passed through him.</p>
                <p>Because there was nothing to strike.</p>
                <p>Kael had become stillness.</p>
                <p>The blade shattered.</p>
                <p>So did she.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>Epilogue: The Idle King</em></p>
                <p>The world repaired itself slowly.</p>
                <p>The sky healed. Time re-threaded.</p>
                <p>Kael returned to Taran’s Reach.</p>
                <p>But he wasn’t the same.</p>
                <p>He no longer dreamed of war.</p>
                <p>No longer saw ghosts in the mirror.</p>
                <p>He had become idle—not out of apathy, but peace.</p>
                <p>He taught children how to shape words into magic.<br>
                He planted seeds that turned into trees of memory.<br>
                He listened when others spoke, truly listened.</p>
                <p>Some called him a saint. Others, a relic.</p>
                <p>But no one ever saw him raise a weapon again.</p>
                <p>Because he had learned the greatest truth:</p>
                <p>That sometimes, to save the world—</p>
                <p>—you simply have to stop fighting.</p>
                <p>And be still.</p>
