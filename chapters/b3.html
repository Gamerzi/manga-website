            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The forest lay cloaked in mist and moonlight. Silent. Still. Waiting.</p>
                <p>Arjun glided low between the towering trees, his enormous wings nearly brushing the ancient branches. After the battle with the Black Fang mercenaries, he had realized one crucial thing — he could no longer aimlessly wander. He needed allies. He needed knowledge.</p>
                <p>He needed... a new life.</p>
                <p>But beasts were feared. Spirit Beasts, even intelligent ones, were hunted, enslaved, or sealed into spirit weapons by greedy cultivators. No human would ever trust him — not like this.</p>
                <p><em>I need a human form,</em> Arjun thought grimly, feeling the limits of his current existence. <em>Or at least, the ability to speak... to plan.</em></p>
                <p>He had seen records back at Azure Cloud Sect — rare spirit beasts with ancient bloodlines could eventually take human forms, once their cultivation reached a certain level.</p>
                <p>But for now, he had to stay hidden.</p>
                <p>As he passed over a small clearing near a misty riverbank, something caught his sharp eagle eyes.</p>
                <p>A lone figure. Small. Fragile. Human.</p>
                <p>Sitting by the river, wrapped in a tattered cloak, shivering under the cold moonlight.</p>
                <p>A girl — no more than sixteen or seventeen — with long, tangled hair like a waterfall of ink, and pale hands that clutched a worn satchel.</p>
                <p>Even from high above, Arjun could see she was injured. Blood stained her robes. A broken sword lay at her side.</p>
                <p>Arjun circled once, cautious. Was this a trap? Was she bait for hunters?</p>
                <p>But there were no other energy signatures nearby. No mercenaries hiding in the trees. No spiritual arrays set on the ground.</p>
                <p>She was truly... alone.</p>
                <p>Something deep inside him stirred — an echo of the human he used to be. A broken youth abandoned by the world.</p>
                <p>Just like her.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>The girl winced as she tried to move, clutching her side where a deep wound oozed blood.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"No... not here... I have to keep moving," she whispered to herself, voice hoarse and trembling.</p></blockquote>
                <p>But her body betrayed her. She collapsed onto the damp earth, breathing raggedly.</p>
                <p>Tears welled up in her eyes — but she bit her lip hard, refusing to cry.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"I won't die here... not yet... not until I avenge them..."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Her words were almost swallowed by the night winds.</p>
                <p>Arjun landed silently on a nearby branch, folding his wings against his body. He watched her — this stubborn, wounded girl — struggling against the inevitable.</p>
                <p>Something inside him made a decision.</p>
                <p>He couldn't leave her.</p>
                <p>Even if he couldn't speak, even if he couldn't protect her like a human guardian, he could at least watch over her — for tonight.</p>
                <p>He flapped his wings lightly, stirring the air, and sent a small gust toward her.</p>
                <p>The dying campfire nearby flickered back to life, throwing a warm glow over the girl.</p>
                <p>She stirred weakly, opening her eyes — and gasped when she saw the enormous eagle perched above.</p>
                <p>Terror flashed across her face.</p>
                <p>But strangely, she didn’t scream. She didn’t run. She simply... bowed her head slightly.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Mighty spirit beast..." she whispered weakly. "If you wish to devour me... I will not resist."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Arjun blinked, surprised.</p>
                <p>There was no fear in her voice. Only tired resignation — and a strange, quiet dignity.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"But if... you have any mercy..." she coughed, blood flecking her lips, "please... take my satchel to the Temple of Falling Stars... someone there must... know what to do..."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She slumped against the tree trunk, unconscious.</p>
                <p>Arjun swooped down, landing beside her.</p>
                <p>His massive golden form towered over the small, broken girl. For a long moment, he simply stared at her.</p>
                <p>And then, carefully, he nudged the satchel with his beak.</p>
                <p>Inside were scrolls. Medallions. And a small, cracked jade pendant — pulsing faintly with spiritual light.</p>
                <p>A hidden bloodline artifact.</p>
                <p>Arjun's heart tightened.</p>
                <p>This girl wasn't just some wandering beggar…</p>
