                <p>They reached the Gate on the third day.</p>
                <p>It rose from the shattered edge of the world like a wound in reality—two colossal spires of obsidian arcing toward each other, suspended over a chasm so deep even the Riftheart couldn’t measure its bottom. A swirling vortex of light and shadow churned between the spires, held in place by ancient magic and forgotten science.</p>
                <p>Kael stood at the edge, cloak whipping around him in the wind. The Riftheart in his chest pulsed with anticipation and dread. He could feel it—Varok was awake now, aware, and reaching.</p>
                <p>The Gate called to both of them.</p>
                <p>Lira stopped beside him, panting. “That’s it, huh? Doesn’t exactly look like salvation.”</p>
                <p>“It’s not,” Kael said. “It’s the final lock. And once I step through… there’s no coming back.”</p>
                <p>“Then maybe don’t go in alone,” she snapped. “You always think this has to be your burden. You forget who’s still standing next to you.”</p>
                <p>Kael looked at her—truly looked—and for the first time in days, the storm in his chest calmed.</p>
                <p>“I never forgot,” he said. “I just hoped you’d walk away before it was too late.”</p>
                <p>“Not happening.”</p>
                <p>A shimmer rippled through the air above the Gate—and then, reality split.</p>
                <p>From the chasm rose a shape cloaked in void. Varok.</p>
                <p>But not as Kael remembered him.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Broken God</em></p>
                <p>Varok was no longer formless hunger. He had taken shape—a reflection of Kael, twisted and burned. His face was half-masked in bone, eyes glowing with abyssal fire. His body was wrapped in armor forged from broken time, his cloak made of black starlight.</p>
                <p>He smiled with Kael’s mouth.</p>
                <p>“So this is what you’ve become,” he said, voice like cracking ice. “A man playing savior.”</p>
                <p>Kael summoned the Riftblade in a flash of silver flame. “And you’re still playing parasite.”</p>
                <p>Varok tilted his head. “You once chose me.”</p>
                <p>“I once thought power was the answer,” Kael said. “Now I know it’s the lie you tell the desperate.”</p>
                <p>Varok laughed. The sky above twisted, turning dark. Lightning tore through the vortex of the Gate. “You think you can end me? You were me. We were gods together.”</p>
                <p>“We were fools,” Kael said. “Now I’m the fool who ends it.”</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Battle Beyond Reality</em></p>
                <p>Kael launched forward, Riftblade clashing with Varok’s void-forged scythe. The impact sent shockwaves across the Gate. Light and shadow bent around them as they fought—not in space, but in memory.</p>
                <p>Kael was everywhere—on a battlefield of stars, in the ruins of Seros, in his own childhood home, shattered and burning. Varok fought with lies, with fear, with fragments of the past Kael had tried to bury.</p>
                <p>But Kael fought with purpose.</p>
                <p>Every strike of his blade resonated with the Riftheart’s power. Every wound Varok dealt, Kael absorbed, endured, and answered.</p>
                <p>Lira, on the cliff, watched as reality fractured. She raised her hands, and ancient glyphs flared into being around her. She wasn’t a god, but she had learned enough from Kael to fight like one.</p>
                <p>She hurled a spear of light into the fray—it struck Varok in the back, just as Kael drove his blade forward.</p>
                <p>The scythe shattered.</p>
                <p>Varok screamed.</p>
                <p>And the Gate opened wide.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>The Reckoning</em></p>
                <p>The two were dragged inside.</p>
                <p>Kael and Varok tumbled through the breach and into a void outside time.</p>
                <p>Here, there was no up or down. Only memory.</p>
                <p>Kael stood in a field of dead stars. Varok—wounded, snarling—stalked forward.</p>
                <p>“You can’t kill me,” he spat. “I am you.”</p>
                <p>“No,” Kael said. “You’re the part I chose to leave behind.”</p>
                <p>He raised the Riftblade high. “And now I choose to forget you… forever.”</p>
                <p>The Riftheart surged. Energy flooded the space. Kael became light—became fire—became the will of the forgotten gods.</p>
                <p>He struck.</p>
                <p>Varok shattered—his form torn apart, his voice screaming into the abyss as the Gate began to close.</p>
                <p>Kael floated in silence.</p>
                <p>The Riftheart pulsed once more.</p>
                <p>Then—peace.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><em>After the End</em></p>
                <p>Lira knelt at the edge of the Gate for hours, waiting for something—anything.</p>
                <p>Then, from the mist… a figure emerged.</p>
                <p>Kael.</p>
                <p>Barefoot, his cloak gone, his eyes no longer glowing—but alive.</p>
                <p>Lira rushed forward and pulled him into a fierce embrace. “You idiot. You absolute idiot.”</p>
                <p>Kael managed a weak smile. “Took care of it.”</p>
                <p>She punched his shoulder. “Next time, we both die saving the world.”</p>
                <p>“Deal.”</p>
                <p>They stood in silence for a moment, watching the Gate vanish, the vortex sealing with a sound like a final breath.</p>
                <p>The world was safe—for now.</p>
                <p>But Kael knew.</p>
                <p>Magic was rising again.</p>
                <p>And idle gods never stayed idle for long.</p>
