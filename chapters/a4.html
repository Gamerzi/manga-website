            <div id="chapter-content">
                <p>The canyon twisted into a labyrinth.</p>
                <p>Walls of black stone loomed over Kaelen, blotting out the sky.</p>
                <p>The deeper they went, the colder the air became — thin, sharp, biting.</p>
                <p>Selene moved ahead, her pale figure barely visible through the mist that clung to the ground.</p>
                <p>Kaelen followed, each step heavier than the last.</p>
                <p>His body ached.</p>
                <p>The ember inside him — once wild and raging — now simmered, waiting, hungry.</p>
                <p>He didn’t know if he was walking toward salvation… or damnation.</p>
                <p>Maybe both.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>At the canyon's heart, they found it.</p>
                <p>An ancient courtyard carved directly into the stone, ringed by statues long broken and eroded.</p>
                <p>In the center stood a single slab of black iron, half-buried in ash.</p>
                <p>Selene stopped and turned to face him.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"This," she said softly, "is where your training begins."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen frowned, breathing hard.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Training? For what?"</p></blockquote>
                <p>Selene’s eyes gleamed like twin stars.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"For war."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She gestured to the iron slab.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"It is called the Anvil of Ash. Here, the souls of heroes were once tempered — made strong enough to defy even the gods."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen stepped closer, feeling the air ripple with unseen force.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"It looks dead."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Selene’s smile was grim.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Because no one has survived the forging for centuries."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen hesitated.</p>
                <p>He remembered the pain from before — the way the ember had torn through his flesh and spirit.</p>
                <p>This would be worse.</p>
                <p>He knew it.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Why me?" he asked quietly.</p></blockquote>
                <p>Selene studied him.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Because you carry a spark that should not exist. A fragment of a god thought lost forever."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She stepped closer, her voice dropping to a whisper.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"And because if you do not learn to control it — others will. They will bend you, break you, use you."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen's fists clenched.</p>
                <p>No.</p>
                <p>Never again.</p>
                <p>He had been a tool once. A pawn.</p>
                <p>He would rather die than be shackled again.</p>
                <p>Slowly, he nodded.</p>
                <p>Selene’s expression softened for a moment — almost proud.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Good."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She raised her hand.</p>
                <p>The Anvil of Ash shuddered.</p>
                <p>With a groan of tortured metal, it rose fully from the earth — a jagged slab as tall as a man, covered in ancient runes.</p>
                <p>The ground around it blackened, smoking.</p>
                <p>Selene pointed at it.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Place your hand upon the Anvil. Offer your ember willingly. Let it be tempered."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen swallowed hard.</p>
                <p>Every instinct screamed at him to run.</p>
                <p>But he stepped forward.</p>
                <p>He placed his hand against the cold, rough surface.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Pain exploded through him.</p>
                <p>It was different from before — not wild, but methodical. Precise.</p>
                <p>It peeled away his flesh, his memories, his very sense of self — layer by agonizing layer.</p>
                <p>Visions assaulted him:</p>
                <blockquote><p>A battlefield soaked in golden blood.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>A black tower rising into a burning sky.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>A woman’s laughter, cruel and broken.</p></blockquote>
                <p>And beneath it all, a whisper:</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Give in..."</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"Let go..."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen gritted his teeth.</p>
                <p>He saw himself — broken, chained, kneeling.</p>
                <p>He saw himself — burning cities, slaughtering innocents.</p>
                <p>Two futures.</p>
                <p>Two fates.</p>
                <p>Neither one he could accept.</p>
                <p>With a roar, he forced the ember to obey.</p>
                <p>He shaped it — not into a weapon, not into a curse — but into will.</p>
                <p>Unbreakable. Unyielding.</p>
                <p>The Anvil blazed white-hot.</p>
                <p>Kaelen screamed, the sound torn from his very soul — but he did not let go.</p>
                <p>He would not break.</p>
                <p>Not this time.</p>
                <p>Not ever.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>When it ended, he collapsed onto the blackened stone.</p>
                <p>Smoke rose from his skin.</p>
                <p>His cloak was nothing but ashes.</p>
                <p>But when he opened his eyes, he was… different.</p>
                <p>Stronger.</p>
                <p>The ember no longer felt foreign.</p>
                <p>It pulsed in time with his heartbeat — a part of him, and yet something far greater.</p>
                <p>Selene knelt beside him, her face unreadable.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You survived," she said quietly.</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen managed a weak smile.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Was there ever any doubt?"</p></blockquote>
                <p>For the first time, Selene laughed — a short, sharp sound.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"There was always doubt."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She helped him to his feet.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You are tempered now," she said.</p></blockquote>
                <blockquote><p>"But the forging is only the beginning."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She gestured to the statues ringing the courtyard.</p>
                <p>Kaelen looked closer and shuddered.</p>
                <p>They weren’t statues.</p>
                <p>They were bodies — warriors, mages, kings — all frozen mid-scream, their souls consumed by failure.</p>
                <p>Selene’s voice was cold and clear.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"You carry the spark of a god. But so did they."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She met his gaze, hard and unflinching.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Power alone is not enough. Will alone is not enough."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She stepped back, drawing a line in the ash between them.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Only purpose will see you survive what comes next."</p></blockquote>
                <p>Kaelen stood there, the ember burning bright within him.</p>
                <p>Purpose.</p>
                <p>He thought of the hunters.</p>
                <p>Of Black Hollow.</p>
                <p>Of the chains he had shattered — and the ones still binding the world.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"I have a purpose," he said.</p></blockquote>
                <p>Selene’s eyes gleamed with something fierce.</p>
                <blockquote><p>"Then we begin in earnest."</p></blockquote>
                <p>She drew a blade of pure light from the air.</p>
                <p>Kaelen raised his fists.</p>
                <p>Training.</p>
                <p>Survival.</p>
                <p>War.</p>
                <p>The path ahead was blood and fire.</p>
                <p>And Kaelen was ready to walk it.</p>
